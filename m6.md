## Part 1: Data Preparation (Q1 & Q2 Dataset)

**Objective:** Correctly set up your SPSS data file from the provided Excel sheet. Accurate setup is crucial for valid analyses.

**Process:**

1.  **Import:** Import the data from the first worksheet of the Excel file into SPSS.

    - `Hint:` Navigate to `File → Open → Data` and select your Excel file. In the dialog that appears, make sure the "Read variable names from the first row of data" option is checked.

2.  **Configure Variables:** Switch to SPSS's "Variable View". This is where you define your data structure.

    - **Measure Type:** For each variable, consider what kind of data it represents (categorical, continuous ranking, continuous measurement). Assign the appropriate "Measure" level (`Nominal`, `Ordinal`, or `Scale`).

      - `Think:` What distinguishes `Nominal`, `Ordinal`, and `Scale` measures? Which is appropriate for cognitive test scores, age, or educational levels?

    - **Value Labels:** For categorical variables, numeric codes may be used in the data. You need to tell SPSS what these codes mean.

      - `Hint:` Click on the cell in the "Values" column for the variable you want to label, then click the small button with "..." that appears. In the dialog that opens, you can add value-label pairs (e.g., 1="Male", 2="Female").

3.  **Save:** Save your configured SPSS data file (.sav).

## Part 2: Question 1 - Bivariate Linear Regression

**Concept Overview:** Bivariate regression examines the relationship between two variables - a predictor (independent variable) and an outcome (dependent variable). This analysis helps determine if and how one variable can predict another.

### A. Exploratory Correlation Analysis

- **Purpose:** Before running regression, it's important to explore the relationships between variables to identify potential predictors.

- **In SPSS:**
  - From the top menu, select `Analyze → Correlate → Bivariate` as shown below
  
  ![Navigate to Bivariate Correlation](/assets/m6-assets/bivariate-correlation.png)
  
  - In the dialog box that appears, move the variables you want to analyze from the left box to the "Variables" box on the right by selecting them and clicking the blue arrow
  - Ensure "Pearson" is selected under "Correlation Coefficients"
  - Make sure "Two-tailed" is selected under "Test of Significance"
  - Check "Flag significant correlations" to highlight significant results in the output
  
  ![Bivariate Correlation Dialog](/assets/m6-assets/bivariate-correlation-2.png)

- **Interpreting Correlation Results:**
  - Look at the correlation coefficient (r) between each pair of variables
  - The value ranges from -1 to +1
    - r = 0: No linear relationship
    - r = +1: Perfect positive relationship
    - r = -1: Perfect negative relationship
  - Generally:
    - |r| < 0.3: Weak relationship
    - 0.3 ≤ |r| < 0.7: Moderate relationship
    - |r| ≥ 0.7: Strong relationship
  - Also look at significance (p-value)
    - p ≤ 0.05: Statistically significant correlation
    - p > 0.05: No statistically significant correlation

- **Reporting in APA Format:**
  - `Think:` How do you report Pearson's correlation in APA format? Remember to include both r and p values.
  - Example (not from this dataset): r(df) = .56, p = .008
  - Remember to italicize r and p
  - Use r(df) format where df = N - 2 (number of observations minus 2)

### B. Creating a Scatter Plot

- **Purpose:** Visualizing the relationship between two variables helps identify patterns and potential outliers.

- **In SPSS:**
  - From the top menu, select `Graphs → Chart Builder`
  
  ![Navigate to Chart Builder](/assets/m6-assets/chart-builder.png)
  
  - In the Gallery tab, select "Scatter/Dot" from the list on the left
  - Drag the simple scatter plot icon (top left in the gallery) to the chart preview area
  - You will see placeholder boxes for "X-Axis?" and "Y-Axis?"
  - Drag your predictor variable (independent variable) from the variables list to the X-axis box
  - Drag your outcome variable (dependent variable) to the Y-axis box
  
  ![Chart Builder Configuration](/assets/m6-assets/chart-builder-2.png)

- **Examining the Scatter Plot:**
  - `Think:` Does the relationship appear linear? Are there any outliers?
  - `Think:` Does the scatter plot support what you observed in the correlation analysis?
  - `Think:` Is there a clear direction to the relationship (positive or negative)?

### C. Running the Bivariate Regression

- **Purpose:** To quantify the predictive relationship between the predictor and outcome variables.

- **In SPSS:**
  - From the top menu, select `Analyze → Regression → Linear`
  
  ![Navigate to Linear Regression](/assets/m6-assets/linear-regression.png)
  
  - In the dialog box that appears:
    - Move your outcome variable (dependent variable) to the "Dependent:" box
    - Move your predictor variable (independent variable) to the "Independent(s):" box
    - Leave "Method:" as "Enter" (the default)
    - You do not need to fill in the "Selection Variable" or other fields for a basic regression
  
  ![Linear Regression Configuration](/assets/m6-assets/linear-regression-2.png)

- **Key Output Tables:**
  1. **Model Summary Table**
     - First, look for the "Model Summary" table in your output
     - Focus on these key values:
       - R: The correlation coefficient between predicted and observed values
       - R Square: The proportion of variance explained by the model (between 0 and 1)
       - Adjusted R Square: R² adjusted for the number of predictors (important for comparing models)
     - `Think:` What's the difference between R² and Adjusted R²? Why might Adjusted R² be preferred when you have multiple predictors?

     ![Model Summary Table](/assets/m6-assets/linear-regression-model-summary.png)

  2. **ANOVA Table**
     - Next, find the "ANOVA" table in your output
     - Key values to identify:
       - F-statistic: Tests the overall significance of the regression model
       - Significance (Sig.): The p-value for the F-test
       - df: Degrees of freedom (shown as two numbers: regression df, residual df)
     - `Think:` What null hypothesis is being tested here? (Hint: It's about whether the model explains a significant amount of variance)

     ![ANOVA Table](/assets/m6-assets/linear-regression-anova-table.png)

  3. **Coefficients Table**
     - Finally, examine the "Coefficients" table
     - Important components:
       - Unstandardized Coefficients (B): 
         - Constant: The Y-intercept (value of Y when X=0)
         - Predictor variable: The slope (change in Y for each unit increase in X)
       - t-statistic: Tests the significance of each individual predictor
       - Sig.: The p-value for each t-test
     - `Think:` What null hypothesis is being tested by the t-test for each coefficient?

     ![Coefficients Table](/assets/m6-assets/linear-regression-coefficients.png)

- **Interpreting the Results:**
  - If the model's p-value is ≤ 0.05, the regression model is statistically significant
  - If the predictor's p-value is ≤ 0.05, it has a significant relationship with the outcome
  - The B value tells you how much the outcome variable changes for each unit increase in the predictor
  - R² tells you the proportion of variance explained by the model

- **Reporting in APA Format:**
  - For the omnibus test: F(df_regression, df_residual) = [F-value], p = [p-value], adjusted R² = [value]
  - For the coefficient test: t(df) = [t-value], p = [p-value]
  - Remember to italicize F, t, p, and R²
  - `Think:` What's the relationship between the F-test and the t-test in simple regression?

### D. Drawing Conclusions

- **Steps for Interpretation:**
  1. Determine if the overall model is significant (F-test)
  2. Determine if the predictor is significant (t-test)
  3. Assess the practical significance (R² value)
  4. Connect the statistical findings back to the research question

- `Think:` What does it mean practically if your model is significant but explains only a small portion of the variance?

## Part 3: Question 2 - Multiple Linear Regression

**Concept Overview:** Multiple regression extends bivariate regression by including more than one predictor variable. This can often improve the model's predictive power.

### A. Running the Multiple Regression

- **In SPSS:**
  - From the top menu, select `Analyze → Regression → Linear` (same path as for bivariate regression)
  - In the dialog box:
    - Move your outcome variable to the "Dependent:" box
    - Move all your predictor variables (two or more) to the "Independent(s):" box
    - Leave "Method:" as "Enter" (the default)
    - This means all predictors will be entered into the model simultaneously
  - Click "OK" to run the analysis

  ![Multiple Linear Regression Dialog](/assets/m6-assets/multiple-linear-regression.png)

- **Key Output Tables:**
  1. **Model Summary Table**
     - Adjusted R² is particularly important for multiple regression
     - `Think:` Why does Adjusted R² adjust downward as the number of predictors increases?

  2. **ANOVA Table**
     - Tests whether the overall model with all predictors is significant
     - `Think:` What null hypothesis is being tested here?

  3. **Coefficients Table**
     - Now includes standardized coefficients (Beta or β)
     - Each predictor has its own t-test
     - `Think:` What is the difference between B and Beta coefficients? When would you use each?

### B. Interpreting Multiple Regression Results

- **Overall Model Assessment:**
  - Is the model significant (F-test)? What does this tell you?
  - How much variance is explained (Adjusted R²)?
  - `Think:` What does a significant F-test tell you about the collection of predictors?

- **Individual Predictor Assessment:**
  - Which predictors are significant (t-tests)?
  - Which predictor has the strongest relationship with the outcome?
  - `Think:` How do you determine which predictor is the "strongest"?

- **Comparing Predictors:**
  - Use standardized coefficients (Beta) to compare predictors
  - Higher absolute Beta values indicate stronger relationships
  - `Think:` Why can't we directly compare unstandardized coefficients (B) between predictors?

### C. Comparing Regression Models

- **Purpose:** To determine if adding predictors improves the model's ability to explain the outcome variable.

- **Assessment:**
  - Compare Adjusted R² values between the models
  - `Think:` What does a higher Adjusted R² mean in practical terms?
  - `Think:` If adding a predictor increases R² but decreases Adjusted R², what might this suggest?

- **Reporting the Comparison:**
  - Report the change in Adjusted R² between models
  - Discuss whether the addition of predictors meaningfully improves prediction

**Objective:** Correctly set up your SPSS data file for the business context dataset.

**Process:**
- Similar to Part 1, import the data from the appropriate worksheet
- Configure the variables in Variable View
- `Think:` How might the measurement levels differ for business variables compared to cognitive variables?

---

## Part 5: Question 3 - Bivariate Linear Regression (Business Context)

**Concept:** The principles of bivariate regression remain the same, but the context and interpretation change to business outcomes.

### A. Exploratory Correlation Analysis

- Follow the same SPSS steps as in Question 1
- `Think:` What makes a correlation "strong" in a business context? Are the benchmarks different?

### B. Creating a Scatter Plot

- The process is identical to Question 1
- `Think:` How might the pattern of relationships differ in business data?

### C. Running the Bivariate Regression

- Follow the same SPSS steps as in Question 1
- `Think:` How might you interpret the slope (B) in a business context? What practical meaning does it have?

### D. Drawing Conclusions

- Connect statistical findings to the business question
- `Think:` What business decisions might be informed by your findings?

---

## Part 6: Question 4 - Multiple Linear Regression (Business Context)

**Concept:** Similar to Question 2, but applied to business variables.

### A. Running the Multiple Regression

- Follow the same SPSS steps as in Question 2
- `Think:` How does including multiple business factors improve prediction?

### B. Interpreting Multiple Regression Results

- Evaluate the overall model and individual predictors
- `Think:` In a business context, how would you explain the meaning of significant versus non-significant predictors?

### C. Comparing Regression Models

- Similar to Question 2, compare the bivariate and multiple regression models
- `Think:` From a business perspective, when is a more complex model justified?

## Tips for Success

1. **Understand the Research Question:**
   - Always relate your statistical findings back to the original question

2. **Interpret, Don't Just Report:**
   - Explain what the statistical results mean in practical terms
   - Connect statistics to real-world implications

3. **Pay Attention to APA Formatting:**
   - Italicize statistical symbols (r, F, t, p, R²)
   - Report exact p-values when possible (e.g., p = .032), except when very small (p < .001)
   - Include appropriate degrees of freedom

4. **Check Your Logic:**
   - Ensure your conclusions logically follow from your statistical results
   - Be cautious about implying causation from correlation or regression

5. **Focus on Practical Significance:**
   - Statistical significance doesn't always mean practical importance
   - Consider effect sizes (like R²) when interpreting results
