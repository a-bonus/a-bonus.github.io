Download this dataset: Data for M6 Quiz.xlsx Download Data for M6 Quiz.xlsxYou will use the data from the sheet of it entitled "Dataset 2", for questions for which such use is indicated.
Students are allowed two attempts on the quiz by the due date. The higher score will be used toward the calculation of the final grade.
The questions are randomly drawn from a question bank for each attempt, so the two attempts may not have identical questions.
The quiz is open-book/open-note, to be completed in 90 minutes. Once you start this quiz, you must finish it in one sitting because the timer does not stop if you leave the quiz.
The quiz covers the concepts from the readings and video lectures in this module, but may touch on concepts from previous modules.
Note: this is a timed quiz. You may check the remaining time you have at any point while taking the quiz by pressing the keyboard combination SHIFT, ALT, and T... Again: SHIFT, ALT, and T...

Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
What unique information can be gleaned from a multiple linear regression that is not available from a bivariate linear regression?
Group of answer choices

The relative contributions from different predictors to the regression model.

Whether the model effect can be generalized to the population.

The parameters of the regression equation for predicting the outcome variable.

The measure of how well the model fit the data set.

Flag question: Question 3
Question 31 pts
Which statement is accurate about multiple linear regression?
Group of answer choices

The effect of each individual predictor is tested through an F test.

The strength of the Pearson's correlation between a predictor and the outcome variable is usually weaker than that of the semipartial correlation between the same two variables.

Removing a predictor from a multiple regression model always lowers the effect size of the model.

Using the method of "Forward" to build a multiple regression model in SPSS should result in a model with only significant predictors.

Choose, below, the correct, basic, result.
