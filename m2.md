# M2 Assignment Guide: Thinking Through One-Sample t-Tests

This guide will help you navigate the M2 assignment, focusing on the logic behind the one-sample t-test. It covers both manual calculations and SPSS analysis, encouraging you to think critically about hypotheses, test selection, and the interpretation of results.

**Goal:** To build a deep understanding of the one-sample t-test by comparing a sample mean to a known population value, and to master the process of hypothesis testing from formulation to conclusion.

**General Principles:**

- **Start with the Question:** Always translate the research scenario into a specific, testable question before touching any numbers.
- **One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed:** The choice depends entirely on the research question. Does it predict a specific _direction_ of difference ("higher than," "less than"), or just _any_ difference ("different from")?
- **Manual vs. Software:** Manual calculations (Q1) reveal the statistical engine "under the hood." SPSS (Q2, Q3) automates the process, allowing you to focus on interpretation.
- **APA Formatting is Precise:** Pay close attention to the specific conventions for reporting t-test results, including italics, spacing, and the order of statistics.

## Part 1: Data Preparation

**Objective:** Correctly import and configure the M2 dataset. A properly set-up file is essential for accurate analysis. This process is identical to the M1 assignment but with a new dataset.

**Process:**

1.  **Import Data:** Open SPSS and import the data from the provided M2 Excel file (`File -> Import Data -> Excel`).
2.  **Go to "Variable View":** Click the tab at the bottom of the SPSS window.
    - **Measure:** For each variable, set the correct measurement level (`Scale`, `Nominal`, or `Ordinal`). `Think:` Are Age, MMSE, and Education continuous measurements or categories? What about Sex and Marital Status?
    - **Values:** For all `Nominal` and `Ordinal` variables (e.g., Sex, Marital Status), click in the "Values" column to define what the numeric codes represent (e.g., Value `1` = Label `"Male"`).
3.  **Save:** Save your SPSS data file (`.sav`). You will need to submit this file.

## Part 2: Q1 - One-Sample t-Test (MMSE Scores)

**Objective:** To conduct a full one-sample t-test by hand, from hypothesis to conclusion, and then verify the results using SPSS. This question tests your understanding of the entire process.

**First Step: Filter Your Data**

The research question is only about participants aged 75 or older.

- `Hint:` In SPSS, go to `Data -> Select Cases`.
- Choose "If condition is satisfied" and click the "If..." button.
- Enter the condition: `Age >= 75`.
- Click `Continue` and `OK`. SPSS will temporarily filter out all participants younger than 75. Now, any analysis you run will only use the older group. The filtered-out cases will have a slash through their row number.

### 1. Formulate Hypotheses

- **Concept:** The research question predicts a specific direction: that your sample will score **"significantly higher than"** the general population mean of 25. This calls for a directional, or one-tailed, test.
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** This is the "no difference" or "no effect" statement. It posits that your sample's population mean is not higher than the general population mean.
  - _In words:_ The mean MMSE score of the study's population of elderly residents aged 75+ is not higher than 25.
  - _In symbols:_ H₀: µ₁ ≤ 25
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ):** This is your research hypothesis. It directly reflects the "significantly higher than" prediction.
  - _In words:_ The mean MMSE score of the study's population of elderly residents aged 75+ is significantly higher than 25.
  - _In symbols:_ H₁: µ₁ > 25

### 2. Find the Critical t-value

- **Concept:** The critical value is a threshold from a t-distribution table. If your calculated t-statistic is beyond this threshold, your result is statistically significant.
- **Process:**
  1.  Determine your **degrees of freedom (df)**. For a one-sample t-test, `df = n - 1`, where `n` is the number of participants in your selected sample (those aged 75+).
  2.  You are given alpha (α) = .05.
  3.  You are conducting a one-tailed test.
  4.  Look up the value in a t-table where your `df` row intersects with the α = .05 column for a **one-tailed test**. This is your critical t-value.

### 3. Manual Calculations (Show Your Work!)

- **3a. Sample Mean (M):** Sum all the MMSE scores from your selected sample (age 75+) and divide by the sample size (n). `M = ΣX / n`
- **3b. Estimated Population Standard Deviation (s):**
  - `Think:` This is the step where you use `n-1` in the denominator to get an unbiased estimate for the population.
  - Step 1: Calculate the Sum of Squares (SS). `SS = Σ(X - M)²`
  - Step 2: Calculate the variance. `s² = SS / (n-1)`
  - Step 3: Take the square root of the variance. `s = √ (SS / (n-1))`
- **3c. Standard Error of the Mean (sM):** This measures the variability of sample means.
  - `sM = s / √n` (Use the `s` you calculated in 3b).
- **3d. t-statistic:** This is the ratio of the difference between means to the standard error.
  - `t = (M - μ) / sM` (Where `M` is your sample mean, and `μ` is the population mean/test value, which is 25).

### 4. Make a Decision

- Compare your calculated t-statistic (from 3d) to the critical t-value (from 2).
- `Think:` Is your calculated t-statistic further into the tail of the distribution than the critical value?
  - If `t_calculated` > `t_critical`, your result is significant. You **reject the null hypothesis**.
  - If `t_calculated` ≤ `t_critical`, your result is not significant. You **fail to reject the null hypothesis**.

### 5. Answer the Research Question

- Translate your statistical decision back into plain language. For example: "Based on the hypothesis test, the well-educated elderly residents (M = ..., SD = ...) scored significantly higher on the MMSE than the general population, t(...) = ..., p < .05."

### 6. & 7. SPSS Verification and APA Reporting

- **Run the Test in SPSS:**
  - `Hint:` Go to `Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Sample T Test`.
  - Move the `MMSE` variable into the "Test Variable(s)" box.
  - In the "Test Value" box, enter `25`.
  - Click `OK`.

![One-Sample T Test Dialog](/assets/m2-assets/one-sample-t-test.png)

- **Interpret the Output:**
  - Find the table with the t-statistic, df, and p-value ("Sig. (2-tailed)").
  - **Important:** SPSS always provides a _two-tailed_ p-value. For your one-tailed test, you must **divide the SPSS p-value by 2**. If this new value is less than .05, your result is significant.
  - SPSS can also calculate the effect size for you. In the `One-Sample T Test` dialog, click on `Effect Sizes` and check the box. The output will include a table with Cohen's d.

![T-Test Output](/assets/m2-assets/t-test-output.png)

- **APA Reporting:** Combine the key statistics into a single line, formatted precisely.
  - `Example format:` _t_(df) = [t-value], _p_ = [one-tailed p-value], _d_ = [Cohen's d value]
  - **Action:** Paste the main SPSS output table and write your final APA-formatted result.

## Part 3: Q2 - One-Sample t-Test (Age)

**Objective:** To use SPSS to conduct a one-sample t-test and to justify the choice between a one-tailed and two-tailed test.

**First Step: Use the Whole Dataset**

- If you filtered your data in Q1, turn it off. Go to `Data -> Select Cases` and choose "All cases".

![Select All Cases](/assets/m2-assets/select-all-cases.png)

### 1. & 2. Hypotheses and Test Type

- **Concept:** The research question asks if the sample is **"significantly different from"** the norm of 70. It does _not_ specify whether they expect the sample to be older or younger. This lack of a specific direction calls for a non-directional, or **two-tailed**, test.
- **Rationale:** You should perform a two-tailed test because there is no prior theory or strong reason to assume the sample's average age will be only higher or only lower than 70. A significant difference in either direction would be important to know.
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** H₀: µ = 70 (The mean age of the study population is 70.)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** H₁: µ ≠ 70 (The mean age of the study population is different from 70.)

### 3. & 4. Run Test and Make a Decision

- **In SPSS:** `Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Sample T Test`. Use `Age` as the test variable and `70` as the test value.
- **Decision:** Find the p-value ("Sig. (2-tailed)") in the output. Compare this value directly to your alpha level (α = .05).
  - If _p_ ≤ .05: Reject the null hypothesis.
  - If _p_ > .05: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

### 5. & 6. & 7. Conclusion, Effect Size, and APA Reporting

- **Conclusion:** State in words whether the sample's mean age is significantly different from 70.
- **Effect Size:** Report Cohen's d from the SPSS output.
  - `Think:` What does Cohen's d tell you about the practical significance of the finding?
  - Benchmarks for Cohen's d:
    - 0.2 = small effect
    - 0.5 = medium effect
    - 0.8 = large effect
- **APA Report:** Combine the statistics into the correct format.
  - _t_(df) = [t-value], _p_ = [p-value], _d_ = [d-value]
  - **Action:** Paste the SPSS output table and provide your APA-formatted summary.

## Part 4: Q3 - One-Sample t-Test (Education)

**Objective:** To conduct another SPSS-based t-test and practice interpreting both descriptive and inferential statistics.

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- **Concept:** Before running the t-test, it's good practice to look at the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation). This gives you a feel for the data.
- **In SPSS:** The `One-Sample T Test` output automatically includes a table with descriptives (N, Mean, Std. Deviation, Std. Error Mean).
- **Interpretation:**
  - Look at the sample mean for Education. Is it above 16?
  - Look at the standard deviation. `Think:` Does a large SD suggest that education levels are very similar among participants, or that they vary a lot?

### 2. Run Test and Report Results

- **In SPSS:** `Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Sample T Test`. Use `Education` as the test variable and `16` as the test value.
- **Action:** Paste the t-test results table.
- **APA Report:** Write out the full result in APA format, including _t_, df, _p_, and _d_.

### 3. Decision and Rationale

- **Decision:** Based on the p-value from your output, state whether you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Rationale:** Your rationale is the direct comparison of your p-value to the alpha level.
  - Example: "I reject the null hypothesis because the p-value (_p_ = .012) is less than the pre-determined alpha level of .05."
  - Example: "I fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value (_p_ = .245) is greater than the alpha level of .05."

## Tips for Success

1.  **Understand One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests:**

    - The key is in the research question. If it predicts a specific direction ("higher than," "lower than"), use a one-tailed test. If it simply asks whether there's a difference ("different from"), use a two-tailed test.
    - Remember: For one-tailed tests in SPSS, you must divide the reported p-value by 2.

2.  **Show Your Manual Calculations:**

    - For Q1, don't just write the final answer. Show every step of the process, including how you calculated the mean, standard deviation, standard error, and t-statistic. This demonstrates your understanding of what the software is doing automatically.

3.  **Pay Attention to Data Filtering:**

    - Q1 requires filtering the data to only include participants aged 75 or older. Make sure you apply this filter before running your analysis.
    - Remember to turn off the filter (select "All cases") for Q2 and Q3.

4.  **Master APA Formatting:**

    - Italicize statistical symbols: _t_, _p_, _d_, _M_, _SD_
    - Include degrees of freedom in parentheses after t
    - Report exact p-values when possible (e.g., _p_ = .032), unless very small (_p_ < .001)
    - Always include effect size (Cohen's d)
    - Example: _t_(45) = 2.31, _p_ = .025, _d_ = 0.52

5.  **Interpret Effect Sizes:**

    - Statistical significance (_p_ < .05) tells you if an effect exists, but effect size (Cohen's d) tells you how large or meaningful that effect is.
    - A result can be statistically significant but have a small effect size, or vice versa.
    - Always report and interpret both.

6.  **Connect Statistics to Research Questions:**

    - Don't just report numbers. Always translate your statistical findings back into plain language that directly answers the research question.
    - Example: "The sample's mean age (M = 73.2) was significantly different from the population mean of 70, t(99) = 3.45, p = .001, d = 0.47, indicating that the study participants were slightly older than the general elderly population."
