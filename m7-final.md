Every Tuesday night I have to take the trash out for collection early the next morning. Despite my good intentions, someimtes I forget to do this. One recent study explored how simple reminders can help individuals remember to do things in the future (this is called "prospective memory").

To study the effect of reminders on follow through, the researchers recruited 605 individuals from an online participant pool. All participants completed a quiz that allowed them to earn $.03 for each correct answer. Participants could also receive a $.60 bonus, if they selected Choice E for the last question even though that was not the correct answer to the problem. Participants thus needed to remember to follow-through on their intention to select Choice E for the final problem.

Participants were then randomly assigned to one of four conditions:

1. Free-reminder-through-association: these participants were provided the opportunity (for free) to receive a reminder them to select Choice E for the last problem.
2. Control condition: these participants did not receive any reminders to select Choice E for the last problem.
3. Costly-reminder-through-association: these participants decided whether they wanted to pay a fee of $.03 to see a reminder (picture of an elephant) to select Choice E for the last problem.
4. Forced-reminder-through-association: these participants were told that an image of an elephant would appear on the last page of the quiz to remind them to select Choice E.

If these reminders were effective, individuals should earn more money when they have the opportunity to receive the reminders. Conduct an analysis to see whether there was a difference in total earnings (Total_Amount_Earned_if.forced.to.pay.for.cue) between the four conditions ("Condition").

Download: ImpurityDownload Impurity

In this experiment, individuals were assigned to one of two groups: an inauthentic writing condition and a failure condition. In the inauthentic condition, participants were asked to write about a time when they acted in a way that was untrue to their beliefs. In the failure condition, they were asked to write about a time when they failed in an activity, test, or project. After the writing exercise, participants were asked to rate how impure that experience made them feel. The author's hypothesis was that inauthenticity would lead to feeling more impure than failure. Was there a difference in impurity ("impurity_all") between the groups?

Researchers were interested in the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention to increase test performance. Furthermore, they wanted to see whether this writing intervention was more (or less) effective in different types of classes. To test these questions, the researchers used a cognitive psychology class and an introductory statistics class. Within each class, the researchers tested each student twice—once after completing an expressive writing prompt and once after completing a control writing prompt. The dataset provides participants’ test scores in addition to some other variables. Conduct an analysis that will allow you to see if there a difference in test scores between intervention prompts, a difference in test scores between classes, and whether those factors interacted.

Download: ReligiousMotivationDownload ReligiousMotivation

Intrinsic religious motivation describes the degree to which individuals are motivated by internal factors (e.g., personal belief in compassion) rather than external factors (e.g., acting faithfully due to fear of wrath). Researchers have speculated that as an individual’s intrinsic motivation increases, so too will measures of empathy. In contrast, as extrinsic motivation increases, measures of empathy should decrease. Participants in this study completed a questionnaire that included a scale measuring intrinsic religious motivation, a scale measuring extrinsic religious motivation, and a scale measuring empathy.

Conduct an appropriate analysis to explore the relationship between extrinsic motivation and empathy.
