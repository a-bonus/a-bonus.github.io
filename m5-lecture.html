                    <h2>Part 1: Introduction to Factorial ANOVA</h2>

                    <h3>Moving Beyond Single Factors</h3>
                    <p>So far in this course, you've learned to compare groups using:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Independent-samples t-test:</strong> Comparing 2 groups</li>
                        <li><strong>Paired-samples t-test:</strong> Comparing 2 conditions (same participants)</li>
                        <li><strong>One-way ANOVA:</strong> Comparing 3+ groups on one independent variable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But what happens when you want to study <strong>two or more independent variables simultaneously</strong>? That's where <strong>factorial ANOVA</strong> comes in.</p>

                    <h3>Why Not Just Run Multiple One-Way ANOVAs?</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you're studying the effects of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Factor A:</strong> Teaching method (lecture vs. hands-on)</li>
                        <li><strong>Factor B:</strong> Class size (small vs. large)</li>
                        <li><strong>DV:</strong> Student test scores</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You could run two separate one-way ANOVAs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Compare teaching methods (ignoring class size)</li>
                        <li>Compare class sizes (ignoring teaching method)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>But this approach has three major problems:</strong></p>

                    <h4>Problem 1: Inefficiency</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're running multiple separate analyses instead of one comprehensive test</li>
                        <li>More time-consuming and complex to manage</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Problem 2: Inflated Type I Error</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each additional test increases the probability of a false positive</li>
                        <li>Running 2 tests at α = .05 each gives you a familywise error rate > .05</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Problem 3: Missing the Interaction (THE BIG ONE)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The real world is complex.</strong> The effect of one factor often depends on the level of another factor</li>
                        <li>Example: Hands-on teaching might work great in small classes but poorly in large classes</li>
                        <li>Separate one-way ANOVAs can <strong>never</strong> detect this crucial interaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Real-World Examples of Interactions</h3>

                    <h4>Example 1: Education</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teaching method (lecture, discussion, hands-on) × Student level (beginner, advanced)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: Hands-on works best for beginners, but advanced students benefit most from discussion</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example 2: Medicine</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drug dosage (low, medium, high) × Patient age (young, elderly)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: Medium dose is optimal for young patients, but elderly patients need low dose</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example 3: Marketing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advertisement type (emotional, factual) × Product category (luxury, practical)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: Emotional ads work for luxury products, factual ads work for practical products</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example 4: Psychology</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Therapy type (CBT, medication) × Disorder severity (mild, severe)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: CBT works well for mild cases, but severe cases need medication</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Three Advantages of Factorial ANOVA</h3>

                    <h4>1. Efficiency:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Test multiple factors in a single analysis</li>
                        <li>Saves time and resources</li>
                        <li>More elegant research design</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Control of Type I Error:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One omnibus test controls familywise error rate</li>
                        <li>Maintains α = .05 across all comparisons</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Detection of Interactions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>This is the game-changer</strong></li>
                        <li>Reveals how factors work together</li>
                        <li>Provides a more complete, nuanced understanding of your data</li>
                        <li>Often the most interesting and important finding</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>When to Use Factorial ANOVA</h3>

                    <p><strong>Use factorial ANOVA when:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have <strong>2 or more independent variables</strong> (factors)</li>
                        <li>Each factor has <strong>2 or more levels</strong></li>
                        <li>You want to test <strong>main effects</strong> and <strong>interaction effects</strong></li>
                        <li>Your dependent variable is <strong>continuous</strong> (interval or ratio)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Research scenarios:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examining how treatment type and patient characteristics affect outcomes</li>
                        <li>Testing how product features and marketing strategies influence sales</li>
                        <li>Investigating how teaching methods and student characteristics affect learning</li>
                        <li>Studying how environmental factors and genetic factors affect behavior</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Part 2: Factorial Design Fundamentals</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Design Notation</h3>
                    <p>Factorial designs are described using a <strong>notation system</strong> that tells you:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How many factors (IVs) are in the study</li>
                        <li>How many levels each factor has</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>The Notation Format:</strong> A × B × C...</p>

                    <h4>Examples:</h4>

                    <h4>2×2 Design ("two by two"):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 factors</li>
                        <li>First factor has 2 levels</li>
                        <li>Second factor has 2 levels</li>
                        <li>Example: Gender (male, female) × Teaching method (lecture, hands-on)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2×3 Design ("two by three"):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 factors</li>
                        <li>First factor has 2 levels</li>
                        <li>Second factor has 3 levels</li>
                        <li>Example: Gender (male, female) × Class size (small, medium, large)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3×3 Design ("three by three"):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 factors</li>
                        <li>First factor has 3 levels</li>

                    <h3>Calculating the Number of Cells</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>cell</strong> is a unique combination of factor levels. The number of cells equals the number of <strong>unique groups</strong> in your study.</p>

                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Number of cells = Level₁ × Level₂ × Level₃...</p>

                    <h3>Types of Factorial Designs</h3>

                    <h4>Between-Groups (Independent-Groups) Factorial ANOVA:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Different participants</strong> in each cell</li>
                        <li>Most common type of factorial design</li>
                        <li>Example: Different students in each teaching method × class size combination</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Within-Groups (Repeated-Measures) Factorial ANOVA:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Same participants</strong> experience all combinations</li>
                        <li>Requires participants to experience all levels of all factors</li>
                        <li>Less common because it can be impractical</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Mixed-Design Factorial ANOVA:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Combination</strong> of between-groups and within-groups factors</li>
                        <li>Some factors are between-groups, others are within-groups</li>
                        <li>Example: Gender (between) × Time of testing (within: morning, afternoon, evening)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Focus of this lecture:</strong> We'll primarily focus on <strong>between-groups factorial ANOVA</strong>, as it's the most common and is what you'll use in your assignment.</p>

                    <h3>Identifying IVs and DVs in Factorial Studies</h3>

                    <p><strong>Independent Variables (IVs) = Factors:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The variables you manipulate or categorize</li>
                        <li>Each IV has 2+ levels</li>
                        <li>In a 2×3 design, you have 2 IVs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Dependent Variable (DV):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The outcome you measure</li>
                        <li>Must be continuous (interval or ratio scale)</li>
                        <li>Only ONE DV in a two-way ANOVA</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example Study:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Research Question:</strong> "Do community type and religious affiliation affect the percentage of graduates going to college?"</li>
                        <li><strong>IV 1 (Factor A):</strong> Community type (city vs. suburb) - 2 levels</li>
                        <li><strong>IV 2 (Factor B):</strong> Religious affiliation (yes vs. no) - 2 levels</li>
                        <li><strong>DV:</strong> Percentage of graduates going to college (continuous)</li>
                        <li><strong>Design:</strong> 2×2 between-groups factorial ANOVA</li>
                        <li><strong>Cells:</strong> 4 (City-Religious, City-Non-religious, Suburb-Religious, Suburb-Non-religious)</li>

                    <h2>Part 3: Main Effects</h2>

                    <h3>What is a Main Effect?</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>main effect</strong> is the effect of <strong>one independent variable on the dependent variable, averaging across (ignoring) all other independent variables</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> In a two-way ANOVA, you test for <strong>two separate main effects</strong>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Main effect of Factor A</li>
                        <li>Main effect of Factor B</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A main effect tells you whether the levels of one factor differ significantly from each other, <strong>on average</strong>, when you collapse (average) across all levels of the other factor(s).</p>

                    <h3>Main Effect of Factor A</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question asked:</strong> "Does Factor A have an effect on the DV, ignoring Factor B?"</p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Factor A: Community type (city vs. suburb)</li>
                        <li>Factor B: Religious affiliation (yes vs. no)</li>
                        <li>DV: Percentage going to college</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Main Effect of Community Type:</strong></p>
                    <p>Do city schools differ from suburban schools in college-going rates, <strong>averaging across both religious and non-religious schools</strong>?</p>

                    <h3>Main Effect of Factor B</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question asked:</strong> "Does Factor B have an effect on the DV, ignoring Factor A?"</p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Main Effect of Religious Affiliation:</strong></p>
                    <p>Do religious schools differ from non-religious schools in college-going rates, <strong>averaging across both city and suburban schools</strong>?</p>

                    <h3>Marginal Means</h3>
                    <p><strong>Marginal means</strong> are the averages for each level of one factor, collapsed across all levels of the other factor.</p>

                    <p><strong>For Factor A (Community Type):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>H₀:</strong> μ_city = μ_suburb (No difference in college-going rates between city and suburban schools)</li>
                        <li><strong>H₁:</strong> μ_city ≠ μ_suburb (There is a difference)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>For Factor B (Religious Affiliation):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>H₀:</strong> μ_religious = μ_non-religious (No difference between religious and non-religious schools)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Testing Main Effects</h3>
                    <p>Each main effect is tested with its own <strong>F-test</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>F for Factor A:</strong> Tests whether the marginal means for Factor A differ significantly</li>
                        <li><strong>F for Factor B:</strong> Tests whether the marginal means for Factor B differ significantly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Decision Rule (for each main effect):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>p < .05:</strong> Reject H₀, the main effect is significant</li>
                        <li><strong>p ≥ .05:</strong> Fail to reject H₀, the main effect is not significant</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>When Main Effects Have 2 Levels</h3>
                    <p><strong>If a factor has only 2 levels:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A significant F-test tells you which direction the effect goes</li>
                        <li>Just compare the two marginal means</li>
                        <li><strong>No post-hoc tests needed</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>Religious (yes vs. no) has 2 levels</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If F is significant, compare marginal means: 80% vs. 65%</li>
                        <li>Conclusion: Religious schools have higher rates</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>When Main Effects Have 3+ Levels</h3>
                    <p><strong>If a factor has 3 or more levels:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A significant F-test only tells you that differences exist somewhere</li>
                        <li>You <strong>must run post-hoc tests</strong> to determine which specific levels differ</li>
                        <li>Use Tukey, Bonferroni, or Scheffé</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>Class size (small, medium, large) has 3 levels</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If F is significant, marginal means might be: 70%, 75%, 85%</li>
                        <li>Post-hoc tests tell you: Large > Small, Large > Medium, Medium = Small</li>

                    <h2>Part 4: Interaction Effects - The Heart of Factorial ANOVA</h2>

                    <h3>What is an Interaction?</h3>
                    <p>An <strong>interaction effect</strong> occurs when <strong>the effect of one independent variable depends on the level of another independent variable</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Formal Definition:</strong> An interaction exists when the effect of Factor A is <strong>not the same</strong> at all levels of Factor B (or vice versa).</p>

                    <p><strong>Simple Way to Think About It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do the two factors work together in a special way?</li>
                        <li>Does the effect of one factor change depending on the other factor?</li>
                        <li>Is the pattern different for different groups?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why Interactions Are the Most Important Finding</h3>
                    <p><strong>THE GOLDEN RULE:</strong> In factorial ANOVA, <strong>the interaction is almost always the most interesting and important finding</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Interactions reveal complexity:</strong> They show how the real world works</li>
                        <li><strong>Interactions are more informative:</strong> They tell you when and for whom an effect occurs</li>
                        <li><strong>Interactions change interpretation:</strong> A significant interaction can make main effects misleading</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Critical Point:</strong> If you have a significant interaction, <strong>you must interpret it carefully</strong> and be cautious about interpreting main effects.</p>

                    <h3>Examples of Interactions</h3>

                    <h4>Example 1: Teaching Method × Student Level</h4>

                    <p><strong>No Interaction:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hands-on is better than lecture for BOTH beginners and advanced students</li>
                        <li>The difference is the same for both groups</li>
                        <li>Effect of teaching method does NOT depend on student level</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Interaction Present:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hands-on is much better for beginners, but lecture is better for advanced students</li>
                        <li>The effect of teaching method DOES depend on student level</li>
                        <li>The pattern reverses across groups</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example 2: Drug Dosage × Age</h4>

                    <p><strong>No Interaction:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Higher doses work better for both young and elderly patients</li>
                        <li>The pattern is the same for both age groups</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Interaction Present:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Higher doses work better for young patients, but lower doses work better for elderly</li>
                        <li>The optimal dosage depends on age</li>
                        <li>What works for one group doesn't work for the other</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example 3: Study Location × Gender</h4>

                    <p><strong>No Interaction:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Library is best for both males and females</li>
                        <li>The rank order of locations is the same for both genders</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Interaction Present:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Library is best for females, but home is best for males</li>
                        <li>The best study location depends on gender</li>
                        <li>You can't give one recommendation for everyone</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Visualizing Interactions with Line Graphs</h3>
                    <p>Interaction plots show the dependent variable on the Y-axis, one factor on the X-axis, and separate lines for each level of the other factor.</p>

                    <h4>No Interaction Pattern (Parallel Lines):</h4>
                    <p>Imagine a graph where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>X-axis shows Teaching Method: Lecture → Hands-on</li>
                        <li>Y-axis shows Test Scores (0-100)</li>
                        <li>Two lines: one for Males (solid), one for Females (dashed)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Both lines rise from left to right at the SAME angle:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Males: 40 → 60 (increase of 20 points)</li>
                        <li>Females: 80 → 100 (increase of 20 points)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The lines stay parallel and never meet.</p>

                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Hands-on is better than lecture for BOTH groups by the same amount (20 points). The effect of teaching method doesn't depend on gender.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h4>Interaction Pattern (Non-Parallel Lines):</h4>
                    <p>Imagine a graph where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>X-axis shows Teaching Method: Lecture → Hands-on</li>
                        <li>Y-axis shows Test Scores (0-100)</li>
                        <li>Two lines: one for Males (solid), one for Females (dashed)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Lines move in opposite directions and CROSS:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Males: 60 → 40 (decrease of 20 points)</li>
                        <li>Females: 80 → 100 (increase of 20 points)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The lines intersect in the middle of the graph.</p>

                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> The effect of teaching method DEPENDS on gender. Females benefit from hands-on while males do worse. Males do better with lecture.</p>

                    <h4>Key Visual Cues:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Parallel lines</strong> = No interaction (consistent effect across groups)</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-parallel lines</strong> = Possible interaction (effect varies by group)</li>
                        <li><strong>Crossing lines</strong> = Definite interaction (effect reverses across groups)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Types of Interactions</h3>

                    <h4>1. Crossover Interaction:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The lines actually cross</li>
                        <li>The rank order reverses</li>
                        <li>Example: Drug A is best for young, Drug B is best for elderly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Spreading Interaction:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lines diverge but don't cross</li>
                        <li>One factor has a bigger effect at certain levels of the other factor</li>
                        <li>Example: Hands-on helps beginners much more than it helps advanced students</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. No Interaction:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lines are parallel (or close to it)</li>
                        <li>One factor has the same effect at all levels of the other factor</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Hypotheses for Interaction Effects</h3>

                    <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is no interaction between Factor A and Factor B</li>
                        <li>The effect of Factor A is the same at all levels of Factor B</li>
                        <li>The lines on the graph will be parallel</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is an interaction between Factor A and Factor B</li>
                        <li>The effect of Factor A depends on the level of Factor B</li>
                        <li>The lines on the graph will not be parallel</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What a Significant Interaction Tells You</h3>

                    <p><strong>If the interaction is significant (p < .05):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ The effect of one factor <strong>depends on</strong> the level of the other factor</li>
                        <li>✅ You <strong>cannot</strong> make simple statements like "Factor A increases the DV"</li>
                        <li>✅ You <strong>must</strong> explore the interaction with simple effects tests</li>
                        <li>✅ This is your <strong>main story</strong> to report</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example Interpretation:</h4>
                    <p>"The effect of teaching method on test scores depends on student level. Hands-on instruction is more effective for beginners, while lecture is more effective for advanced students."</p>

                            <p class="answer-text"><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) On average, watchers differ in their geekiness levels across the various hours of the Syfy channel watched.</p>
                            <p class="answer-text"><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The research hypothesis for a main effect predicts that there will be differences across the levels of that factor (hours watched), averaging across the other factor (gender). This statement says geekiness differs across hours watched.</p>

                    <h2>Part 5: The Omnibus Test in Two-Way ANOVA</h2>

                    <h3>Three Separate Null Hypotheses</h3>
                    <p>In a two-way ANOVA, the <strong>omnibus test</strong> actually tests <strong>three separate null hypotheses simultaneously</strong>:</p>

                    <h4>H₀₁: Main Effect of Factor A</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>μ_A1 = μ_A2 = μ_A3... (all marginal means for Factor A are equal)</li>
                        <li>Example: μ_city = μ_suburb</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>H₀₂: Main Effect of Factor B</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>μ_B1 = μ_B2 = μ_B3... (all marginal means for Factor B are equal)</li>
                        <li>Example: μ_religious = μ_non-religious</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>H₀₃: Interaction Between A and B</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is no interaction between Factor A and Factor B</li>
                        <li>The effect of Factor A is the same at all levels of Factor B</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Each of these three hypotheses is tested with its own <strong>separate F-test</strong>, meaning you get three F-statistics in your output.</p>

                    <h3>In a Two-Way ANOVA, the Researcher Makes Decisions Regarding...</h3>
                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Three separate null hypotheses</p>

                    <p>This is a critical concept that distinguishes two-way ANOVA from simpler tests:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One-way ANOVA: 1 null hypothesis (one factor)</li>
                        <li>Independent t-test: 1 null hypothesis (two groups)</li>
                        <li>Two-way ANOVA: <strong>3 null hypotheses</strong> (2 main effects + 1 interaction)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Variance Partitioning in Factorial ANOVA</h3>
                    <p>In one-way ANOVA, we partitioned variance into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Between-groups variance</li>
                        <li>Within-groups variance</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>In two-way ANOVA, between-groups variance is further divided into THREE components:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Total Between-Groups Variance = Main Effect A + Main Effect B + Interaction (A×B)</strong></p>

                    <p>This is why factorial ANOVA is so powerful—it breaks down the differences among groups into interpretable pieces:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How much is due to Factor A alone?</li>
                        <li>How much is due to Factor B alone?</li>
                        <li>How much is due to the combination/interaction of A and B?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Visual Representation:</h4>

                    <h3>Understanding Degrees of Freedom in Factorial ANOVA</h3>
                    <p><strong>Degrees of freedom</strong> become more complex in factorial designs because we're testing multiple effects.</p>

                    <h4>Between-Groups Degrees of Freedom:</h4>

                    <h4>df for Main Effect A:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>df_A = a - 1</li>
                        <li>Where a = number of levels of Factor A</li>
                        <li>Example: 2 community types → df = 2 - 1 = 1</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>df for Main Effect B:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>df_B = b - 1</li>
                        <li>Where b = number of levels of Factor B</li>
                        <li>Example: 2 religious affiliations → df = 2 - 1 = 1</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>df for Interaction (A × B):</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>df_A×B = (a - 1) × (b - 1)</li>
                        <li>Example: (2-1) × (2-1) = 1 × 1 = 1</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Within-Groups Degrees of Freedom:</h4>

                    <h4>df for Within-Groups (Error):</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Where N = total number of participants, a × b = total number of cells</li>
                        <li>Alternative formula: Subtract 1 participant from each cell, then add up</li>
                        <li>Example: 60 participants, 2×2 design (4 cells) → df = 60 - 4 = 56</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Total Degrees of Freedom:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>df_total = N - 1</li>
                        <li>Example: 60 participants → df = 60 - 1 = 59</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Check:</strong> df_A + df_B + df_A×B + df_within = df_total</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: 1 + 1 + 1 + 56 = 59 ✓</li>

                    <h2>Part 6: The Decision Tree - Interpreting Factorial ANOVA Results</h2>

                    <h3>The Golden Rule: Check the Interaction FIRST</h3>
                    <p><strong>Most Important Principle in Factorial ANOVA:</strong></p>
                    <p>When interpreting your results, <strong>ALWAYS examine the interaction effect before looking at the main effects.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interaction tells you whether the main effects can be interpreted independently</li>
                        <li>A significant interaction changes how you interpret everything else</li>
                        <li>The interaction is usually the most interesting and informative finding</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Decision Tree</h3>
                    <pre>
Step 1: Look at the Interaction (A × B)
    |
    ├─ Is interaction significant (p < .05)?
    |    |
    |    ├─ YES → Interaction is SIGNIFICANT
    |    |    |
    |    |    ├─ 1. Report the significant interaction as your main finding
    |    |    ├─ 2. Run SIMPLE EFFECTS tests to explore the interaction
    |    |    ├─ 3. Interpret main effects with EXTREME CAUTION (or ignore them)
    |    |    └─ 4. Focus on describing the pattern of the interaction
    |    |
    |    └─ NO → Interaction is NOT SIGNIFICANT
    |         |
    |         ├─ 1. Report that the interaction is not significant
    |         ├─ 2. NOW you can interpret main effects independently
    |         └─ 3. For each significant main effect:
    |              |
    |              ├─ If factor has 2 levels → Compare marginal means
    |              └─ If factor has 3+ levels → Run POST-HOC tests
                    </pre>

                    <h3>When the Interaction is Significant</h3>

                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The effect of Factor A depends on the level of Factor B</li>
                        <li>You cannot make simple statements like "Factor A increases the DV"</li>
                        <li>The two factors work together in a complex way</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Report the interaction:</strong> "There was a significant interaction between A and B, F(1, 56) = 35.62, p < .001."</li>
                        <li><strong>Run simple effects tests:</strong> Break down your data by levels of one factor and test the effect of the other factor separately at each level</li>
                        <li><strong>Describe the pattern:</strong> Explain how the effect of one factor changes across levels of the other</li>
                        <li><strong>Be cautious with main effects:</strong> If you report them at all, note that they must be interpreted in light of the significant interaction</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Example Interpretation:</h4>
                    <p>"The effect of religious affiliation on college-going rates depends on community type. In city schools, religious affiliation had a large significant effect (p < .001), but in suburban schools, the effect was not significant (p = .45)."</p>

                    <h3>When the Interaction is NOT Significant</h3>

                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The effect of Factor A is consistent across all levels of Factor B</li>
                        <li>The two factors work independently</li>
                        <li>Main effects can be interpreted separately</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Report that interaction is not significant:</strong> "There was no significant interaction, F(1, 56) = 0.85, p = .36."</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpret each main effect separately:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For each significant main effect with 2 levels: Compare marginal means</li>
                                <li>For each significant main effect with 3+ levels: Run post-hoc tests</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Example Interpretation:</h4>
                    <p>"There was no significant interaction. The main effect of community type was significant, F(1, 56) = 106.74, p < .001, with suburban schools having higher rates than city schools. The main effect of religious affiliation was also significant, F(1, 56) = 70.29, p < .001, with religious schools having higher rates than non-religious schools."</p>

                    <h3>When to Run Post-Hoc Tests</h3>

                    <p><strong>Post-hoc tests are needed when:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interaction is <strong>NOT significant</strong>, AND</li>
                        <li>A main effect is <strong>significant</strong>, AND</li>
                        <li>That factor has <strong>3 or more levels</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>When post-hoc tests are NOT needed:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interaction is significant (run simple effects tests instead)</li>
                        <li>Main effect has only 2 levels (just compare marginal means)</li>
                        <li>Main effect is not significant</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example from Quiz:</h4>
                    <p>Based on ANOVA results showing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community effect: F = 106.74, p < .001 (2 levels: city, suburb)</li>
                        <li>Religious effect: F = 70.29, p < .001 (2 levels: yes, no)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: F = 35.62, p < .001</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Answer: Post hoc tests are not necessary</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Why?</strong> The interaction is significant, so you should run simple effects tests instead. Even if the interaction weren't significant, both main effects have only 2 levels each, so no post-hoc tests would be needed—just compare the two marginal means for each factor.</p>

                    <h3>Caution: Don't Over-Interpret Main Effects with Significant Interactions</h3>

                    <p><strong>Common Mistake:</strong></p>
                    <p>Reporting "Religious schools have higher college-going rates" when there's a significant interaction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                    <p>This statement might be true on average (the marginal means), but it hides the complexity revealed by the interaction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Better Approach:</strong></p>
                    <p>"The effect of religious affiliation depends on community type. In city schools, religious schools have much higher rates (85% vs. 60%), but in suburban schools, the difference is smaller (88% vs. 75%)."</p>

                    <h2>Part 7: Simple Effects Tests</h2>

                    <h3>What Are Simple Effects?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Simple effects</strong> are the effects of one factor at <strong>individual levels</strong> of the other factor.</p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>Instead of asking "Does teaching method affect scores?" (main effect), we ask:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Does teaching method affect scores <strong>for beginners</strong>?" (simple effect at beginner level)</li>
                        <li>"Does teaching method affect scores <strong>for advanced students</strong>?" (simple effect at advanced level)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Simple effects tests help you understand and describe the pattern of a significant interaction.</p>

                    <h3>When to Run Simple Effects Tests</h3>

                    <p><strong>Run simple effects tests when:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interaction is <strong>significant</strong> (p < .05)</li>
                        <li>You want to understand <strong>how</strong> the two factors interact</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Do NOT run simple effects tests when:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interaction is <strong>not significant</strong></li>
                        <li>In that case, interpret main effects instead</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How Simple Effects Tests Work</h3>

                    <h4>Approach 1: Split by Factor A, Test Effect of Factor B</h4>

                    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Split your data into separate groups based on Factor A levels</li>
                        <li>For each level of Factor A, run a one-way ANOVA testing the effect of Factor B</li>
                        <li>Compare results across the different levels of Factor A</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Split data by Community Type (City schools only, Suburb schools only)</li>
                        <li>For City schools: Run one-way ANOVA testing effect of Religious affiliation</li>
                        <li>For Suburb schools: Run one-way ANOVA testing effect of Religious affiliation</li>
                        <li>Compare: Is the effect of Religious different in City vs. Suburb?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Approach 2: Split by Factor B, Test Effect of Factor A</h4>
                    <p>You could also do it the other way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Split data by Religious affiliation (Religious schools only, Non-religious schools only)</li>
                        <li>Test effect of Community Type separately for each group</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Choose based on your research question and which makes more conceptual sense.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Interpreting Simple Effects Results</h3>

                    <h4>Example Results:</h4>

                    <h4>City Schools:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Religious vs. Non-religious: F(1, 28) = 45.23, p < .001</li>
                        <li>Religious schools: M = 85%, Non-religious: M = 60%</li>
                        <li><strong>Large, significant effect of religious affiliation</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Suburban Schools:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Religious vs. Non-religious: F(1, 28) = 2.15, p = .154</li>
                        <li>Religious schools: M = 88%, Non-religious: M = 82%</li>
                        <li><strong>No significant effect of religious affiliation</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
                    <p>"The effect of religious affiliation on college-going rates depends on community type. In city schools, religious affiliation has a large significant effect (religious schools: 85%, non-religious: 60%), F(1, 28) = 45.23, p < .001, η² = .62. However, in suburban schools, there is no significant difference between religious and non-religious schools (88% vs. 82%), F(1, 28) = 2.15, p = .154."</p>

                    <h3>Simple Effects in SPSS</h3>

                    <h4>Method: Split File and Run One-Way ANOVAs</h4>

                    <h4>Step 1: Split the data</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Data → Split File</li>
                        <li>Select "Organize output by groups"</li>
                        <li>Move the splitting variable (e.g., Community Type) to "Groups Based on"</li>
                        <li>Click OK</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Step 2: Run One-Way ANOVA</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Analyze → Compare Means → One-Way ANOVA</li>
                        <li>DV: College percentage</li>
                        <li>Factor: Religious affiliation</li>
                        <li>Click OK</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> SPSS will run separate one-way ANOVAs for each level of Community Type</p>

                    <h4>Step 3: Turn off Split File</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Data → Split File</li>
                        <li>Select "Analyze all cases, do not create groups"</li>

                    <h2>Part 8: Effect Size in Factorial ANOVA</h2>

                    <h3>Why Effect Size Matters</h3>
                    <p>Just like with other ANOVAs, statistical significance (p-value) doesn't tell you about <strong>practical significance</strong>. Effect sizes answer the question: "How much of the variance in the DV is explained by the IVs?"</p>

                    <h3>Effect Sizes for Each Effect</h3>
                    <p>In factorial ANOVA, you can calculate effect sizes for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Main effect of Factor A</li>
                        <li>Main effect of Factor B</li>
                        <li>Interaction effect (A × B)</li>
                        <li>Total model (all effects combined)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Partial Eta Squared (Partial η²)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Partial η²</strong> is the most commonly reported effect size for factorial ANOVA.</p>

                    <p><strong>Formula for each effect:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Partial η² = SS_effect / (SS_effect + SS_error)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example from SPSS Output:</h4>
                    <pre>
Source                     SS          Partial η²

                    <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community: 65.6% of variance (after removing other effects)</li>
                        <li>Religious: 55.7% of variance (after removing other effects)</li>
                        <li>Interaction: 33.0% of variance (after removing other effects)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Total R² (R-Squared)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Total R²</strong> tells you how much variance is explained by the <strong>entire model</strong> (all effects combined).</p>

                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>R² = SS_between_total / SS_total</li>
                        <li>Where SS_between_total = SS_A + SS_B + SS_A×B</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Example Calculation:</h4>
                    <pre>
SS_Community = 12600.840
SS_Religious = 8294.400
SS_Interaction = 3360.400
SS_between_total = 12600.840 + 8294.400 + 3360.400 = 24255.640

SS_total = 30871.960

R² = 24255.640 / 30871.960 = .786 (78.6%)
                    </pre>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The combined model (community type, religious affiliation, and their interaction) explains 78.6% of the variance in college-going rates.</p>

                    <h3>Cohen's Guidelines for η²</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small effect:</strong> η² = .01 (1% of variance)</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium effect:</strong> η² = .06 (6% of variance)</li>
                        <li><strong>Large effect:</strong> η² = .14 (14% of variance)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are general guidelines. Context matters!</p>

                    <h3>Reporting Effect Sizes</h3>
                    <p><strong>Always report effect sizes alongside F-statistics:</strong></p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>"There was a significant main effect of community type, F(1, 56) = 106.74, p < .001, partial η² = .656, indicating a large effect. There was also a significant interaction between community type and religious affiliation, F(1, 56) = 35.62, p < .001, partial η² = .330."</p>

                    <h2>Part 9: Assumptions of Factorial ANOVA</h2>

                    <h3>The Four Critical Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>Like all statistical tests, factorial ANOVA has assumptions that must be reasonably met for results to be valid.</p>

                    <h4>Assumption 1: Independence of Observations</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each participant's score must be independent of all other participants</li>
                        <li>Violated by: Related participants (siblings, couples), repeated measures, clustered data</li>
                        <li><strong>How to check:</strong> Consider your research design and data collection method</li>
                        <li><strong>Most important assumption</strong> - violations seriously compromise results</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Assumption 2: Normality</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed <strong>within each cell</strong></li>
                        <li>More important with small sample sizes (n < 30 per cell)</li>
                        <li>ANOVA is robust to mild violations, especially with equal cell sizes</li>
                        <li><strong>How to check in SPSS:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Run Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Explore</li>
                                <li>Request histograms and Shapiro-Wilk test for each cell</li>
                                <li>Look for extreme skewness (±2) or kurtosis (±7)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Assumption 3: Homogeneity of Variance</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variance should be approximately equal across all cells</li>
                        <li>Tested with Levene's test in SPSS output</li>
                        <li>ANOVA is fairly robust if cell sizes are equal</li>
                        <li><strong>How to check:</strong> Levene's test in SPSS (p > .05 indicates assumption met)</li>
                        <li><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Largest cell SD should be < 2× smallest cell SD</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Assumption 4: No Significant Outliers</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extreme outliers can distort means and inflate variance</li>
                        <li><strong>How to check in SPSS:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Look at boxplots (values beyond 3× IQR)</li>
                                <li>Check standardized residuals (values > ±3.29 are concerning)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What to Do When Assumptions Are Violated</h3>

                    <h4>If Independence is Violated:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>⚠️ STOP - This is serious</li>
                        <li>Consider multilevel modeling or repeated-measures ANOVA instead</li>
                        <li>Cannot proceed with standard factorial ANOVA</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>If Normality is Violated:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With n > 30 per cell: Probably okay (Central Limit Theorem)</li>
                        <li>With smaller samples: Consider data transformation (log, square root)</li>
                        <li>Alternative: Use non-parametric methods or bootstrapping</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>If Homogeneity of Variance is Violated:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If cell sizes are equal (within 10%): Probably okay to proceed</li>
                        <li>If cell sizes are unequal: Use Welch's correction or report robust statistics</li>
                        <li>Consider reporting with caution and noting the violation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>If Outliers are Present:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigate: Data entry error? True extreme case?</li>
                        <li>Options: Remove (if error), winsorize (cap at less extreme value), or transform data</li>
                        <li>Always report how you handled outliers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Template:</h4>
                    <p>"A two-way between-groups ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of [Factor A] and [Factor B] on [DV]. The omnibus test was significant, F(df₁, df₂) = X.XX, p < .001, indicating that the model significantly explained variance in [DV]."</p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>"A 2×2 between-groups ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of community type (city vs. suburb) and religious affiliation (yes vs. no) on the percentage of graduates going to college. The omnibus test was significant, F(3, 56) = 68.50, p < .001, indicating that the model significantly explained variance in college-going rates."</p>

                    <h4>Template:</h4>
                    <p>"There was a [significant/non-significant] main effect of [Factor], F(df₁, df₂) = X.XX, p = .XXX, partial η² = .XX. [Describe direction if significant]."</p>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>

                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>"There was a significant interaction between community type and religious affiliation, F(1, 56) = 35.62, p < .001, partial η² = .33. Simple effects tests revealed that the effect of religious affiliation was significant in city schools, F(1, 28) = 45.23, p < .001, with religious schools showing substantially higher rates (85% vs. 60%), but not significant in suburban schools, F(1, 28) = 2.15, p = .154 (88% vs. 82%)."</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Factorial ANOVA</strong> allows testing of multiple IVs and their interaction simultaneously</li>
                        <li><strong>Design notation</strong> (e.g., 2×3) indicates number of levels for each factor</li>
                        <li><strong>Number of cells</strong> = levels of Factor 1 × levels of Factor 2</li>
                        <li><strong>Main effects</strong> examine each IV separately, averaging across the other IV(s)</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction effects</strong> show when the effect of one IV depends on the other IV</li>
                        <li><strong>Three null hypotheses</strong> are tested: Main effect A, Main effect B, Interaction A×B</li>
                        <li><strong>Between-groups variance</strong> is partitioned into two main effects and one interaction</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction is paramount</strong>: Always check interaction first before interpreting main effects</li>
                        <li><strong>Simple effects tests</strong> explore significant interactions</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-hoc tests</strong> are for significant main effects with 3+ levels (when interaction is not significant)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Essential Formulas</h3>

                    <h4>Degrees of Freedom:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>df_A = a - 1</li>
                        <li>df_B = b - 1</li>
                        <li>df_A×B = (a - 1) × (b - 1)</li>
                        <li>df_within = N - (a × b)</li>
                        <li>df_total = N - 1</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Effect Sizes:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Partial η² = SS_effect / (SS_effect + SS_error)</li>
                        <li>Total R² = SS_between_total / SS_total</li>
                        <li>SS_between_total = SS_A + SS_B + SS_A×B</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Variance Partitioning:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Total Variance = Between-Groups + Within-Groups</li>
                        <li>Between-Groups = Main Effect A + Main Effect B + Interaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Decision Tree (Summary)</h3>
                    <pre>
1. Check INTERACTION first
   ↓
2. Interaction significant?
   ├─ YES → Run SIMPLE EFFECTS tests
   │         Report interaction pattern
   │         Be cautious with main effects
   │
   └─ NO  → Interpret MAIN EFFECTS independently
             Run POST-HOC tests for factors with 3+ levels
