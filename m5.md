# M5 Assignment Guide: Thinking Through Two-Way ANOVA Analyses

This guide will help you navigate the M5 assignment, focusing on the _why_ behind the steps in Two-Way ANOVA analyses. It encourages you to think critically about the process and interpret results thoughtfully. Use the hints provided to steer you in the right direction in SPSS and your interpretations.

**Goal:** To develop your understanding and application of Two-Way ANOVA techniques by actively engaging with the data and research questions.

**General Principles:**

- Always consider the research question first. What are you trying to find out?
- Understand the structure of a factorial design and how to interpret interactions.
- Don't just report numbers; interpret what they mean in the context of the research questions.
- APA format requires specific conventions – pay attention to italics, p-value reporting, etc.

## Part 1: Data Preparation (Q1 & Q2 Datasets)

**Objective:** Correctly set up your SPSS data files from the provided Excel sheets. Accurate setup is crucial for valid analyses.

**Process:**

1.  **Import:** Import the data from the respective worksheets of the Excel file into SPSS.

    - `Hint:` SPSS has a dedicated function for importing data directly from Excel files under the `File` menu. Ensure variable names are read correctly.

2.  **Configure Variables:** Switch to SPSS's "Variable View". This is where you define your data structure.

    - **Measure Type:** For each variable, consider what kind of data it represents. Assign the appropriate "Measure" level:

      - `Nominal` for categorical variables that represent categories or groups
      - `Scale` for continuous measurements that represent a continuous scale like depression scores

    - **Value Labels:** For categorical variables, numeric codes are used in the data. You need to tell SPSS what these codes mean.

      - `Hint:` The "Values" column in Variable View is where you link numeric codes to their text labels. Consult the Codebook for the correct codes and labels.

3.  **Save:** Save your configured SPSS data files (.sav).

## Part 2: Question 1 - Two-Way ANOVA (Marital Status, Education & Salary)

**Research Questions:**

- Is basic marital status (married versus unmarried) a significant factor in salary?
- Is education a significant factor in salary?
- Is there a significant interaction between basic marital status and education in terms of salary?

### A. Hypotheses and Variables

- **Identify:**

  - When setting up a Two-Way ANOVA, you need to identify which variable is being measured (the dependent variable) and which variables define your groups (the independent variables).
  - `Think:` Which variable represents an outcome or measurement? Which variables represent categories or groups being compared?

- **Null Hypotheses (*H*₀):**

  - For a Two-Way ANOVA, you'll need to formulate three null hypotheses:

    1. The omnibus null hypothesis: This is for the overall model. It is represented by the "Corrected Model" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the omnibus means that you're stating if the entire model is significant or not.
    2. Your main effect of basic marital status can be represented by the "MarriedSingle" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the main effect of basic marital status means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of basic marital status on salary.
    3. Your main effect of education can be represented by the "Ed" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the main effect of education means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of education on salary.
    4. Your interaction effect can be represented by the "MarriedSingle \* Ed" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the interaction effect means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of the combination of basic marital status and education on salary.

  - `Hint:` Each null hypothesis should state that there is no significant effect on the dependent variable.

### B. Running the Two-Way ANOVA

- **Concept:** Two-Way ANOVA allows us to examine how two independent variables (factors) influence a continuous dependent variable, both individually (main effects) and together (interaction effect).

- **In SPSS:**

  - Go to `Analyze -> General Linear Model -> Univariate`
  - Put your dependent variable (the outcome measure you identified) in the "Dependent Variable" box
  - Put your two independent variables (the grouping factors) in the "Fixed Factor(s)" box

  ![Univariate Dialog](/assets/m5-assets/univariate.png)

  ![Dependent Variable Selection](/assets/m5-assets/dv.png)

- **Options to Select:**

  - Under `Options`, check "Descriptive statistics" and "Estimates of effect size"

  ![Options Dialog](/assets/m5-assets/options.png)

  - Under `Plots`, create plots for the main effects and interaction:
    - For main effects: Put each IV on the horizontal axis for separate plots
    - For interaction: Put one IV on the horizontal axis and the other as separate lines

  ![Plots Dialog](/assets/m5-assets/plots.png)

### C. Interpreting the Omnibus Effect

- **Concept:** The omnibus effect tells us if the overall model (combining both IVs and their interaction) significantly explains variance in the DV.

- **Find in Output:** Look for the "Tests of Between-Subjects Effects" table. The "Corrected Model" row shows the omnibus effect.

  ![Tests of Between-Subjects Effects](/assets/m5-assets/test-of-between-subjects.png)

- **Interpretation:**

  1. Look at the p-value (Sig.) for the "Corrected Model" row
  2. Compare to alpha (α = 0.05)
     - If p ≤ 0.05: The model is significant. The combination of factors explains significant variance in the dependent variable.
     - If p > 0.05: The model is not significant. The combination of factors does not explain significant variance in the dependent variable.
  3. Report the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect size (partial eta-squared) in APA format.
     - Example: F(df1, df2) = [F-value], p = [p-value], partial η² = [value]

- **Think:** What does it mean if the model is significant but some individual effects are not? Or if the model is not significant but an individual effect is?

### D. Interpreting Main Effects

- **Concept:** Main effects tell us about the individual impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, averaging across all levels of the other IV.

- **Find in Output:** In the "Tests of Between-Subjects Effects" table, find the rows for each IV (e.g., "MarriedSingle" and "Ed").

- **Null Hypotheses (*H*₀):**

  - For a Two-Way ANOVA, you'll need to formulate three null hypotheses:
    1. The omnibus null hypothesis: This is for the overall model. It is represented by the "Corrected Model" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the omnibus means that you're stating if the entire model is significant or not.
    2. Your main effect of basic marital status can be represented by the "MarriedSingle" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the main effect of basic marital status means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of basic marital status on salary.
    3. Your main effect of education can be represented by the "Ed" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the main effect of education means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of education on salary.
    4. Your interaction effect can be represented by the "MarriedSingle \* Ed" row in the SPSS output.
       - Drawing your conclusion for the interaction effect means that you're stating if there is a significant effect of the combination of basic marital status and education on salary.

- **For Each Main Effect:**

  1. Look at the p-value (Sig.)
  2. Compare to alpha (α = 0.05)
     - If p ≤ 0.05: There is a significant main effect for this IV
     - If p > 0.05: There is no significant main effect for this IV
  3. Report in APA format with F-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and partial eta-squared
  4. Interpret what a significant or non-significant result means in context
     - `Think:` For a significant effect, which group(s) had higher/lower means? What does this tell us about the research question?

- **Visualizing Main Effects:**
  - Create bar graphs for each main effect to visualize the means across groups
  - For the first factor: X-axis shows the levels of this factor, Y-axis shows the mean of your dependent variable
  - For the second factor: X-axis shows the levels of this factor, Y-axis shows the mean of your dependent variable

### E. Interpreting the Interaction Effect

- **Concept:** The interaction effect tells us whether the impact of one IV depends on the level of the other IV. This is often the most interesting finding in a factorial design.

- **Find in Output:** In the "Tests of Between-Subjects Effects" table, find the row with both IVs (e.g., "MarriedSingle \* Ed").

- **Interpretation:**

  1. Look at the p-value (Sig.)
  2. Compare to alpha (α = 0.05)
     - If p ≤ 0.05: There is a significant interaction effect
     - If p > 0.05: There is no significant interaction effect
  3. Report in APA format
  4. Interpret what a significant or non-significant interaction means
     - `Think:` If significant, how does the effect of one IV change depending on the level of the other IV?

- **Visualizing the Interaction:**

  - Create an interaction plot with:
    - X-axis: One independent variable
    - Separate lines: Levels of the other independent variable
    - Y-axis: Mean of the dependent variable
  - Non-parallel lines suggest an interaction
  - Crossing lines suggest a strong interaction

- **Interpreting Interaction Patterns:**
  - `Think:` If lines are parallel, what does that tell us?
  - `Think:` If lines cross, what does that mean?
  - `Think:` If lines have different slopes but don't cross, what does that suggest?

## Part 3: Question 2 - Two-Way ANOVA for the Antidepressant Study

**Research Questions:**

- Is drug type a significant factor in depression score change?
- Is the episode type a significant factor in depression score change?
- Is there a significant interaction between drug type and episode type in terms of depression score change?

### A. Hypotheses and Variables

- **Identify:**

  - Apply the same principles as in Question 1 to identify:
    - The dependent variable (what is being measured as the outcome)
    - The two independent variables (the grouping factors)

- **Null Hypotheses (*H*₀):**
  - Formulate three null hypotheses as you did for Question 1, but specific to this research question:
    1. A null hypothesis about the first factor's effect
    2. A null hypothesis about the second factor's effect
    3. A null hypothesis about the interaction between the two factors

### B. Running the Two-Way ANOVA

- Follow the same procedure as in Q1, but with the appropriate variables for this analysis.

### C. Interpreting Results

- **Omnibus Effect:**

  - Interpret the "Corrected Model" row in the "Tests of Between-Subjects Effects" table
  - Report in APA format and state whether the overall model is significant

- **Main Effects:**

  - Interpret each main effect (the two factors in your analysis)
  - Report statistics in APA format
  - Create bar graphs to visualize each main effect
  - Explain what significant or non-significant main effects mean in context

- **Interaction Effect:**
  - Interpret the interaction effect between your two factors
  - Report in APA format
  - Create an interaction plot
  - Explain what a significant or non-significant interaction means in context
  - `Think:` If there is a significant interaction, does it help explain why one or both main effects might be non-significant?

### D. Clinical Interpretation

- **Think More Deeply:**
  - What do your findings suggest about clinical practice?
  - Does the patient's history matter when deciding on treatment?
  - What additional research questions might these results suggest?

## Tips for Success

1. **Interpret, Don't Just Report:**

   - Don't just state whether an effect is significant or not. Explain what the finding means in the context of the research question.

2. **Visualize Your Results:**

   - Graphs are powerful tools for understanding and communicating results. Make sure your graphs clearly show the pattern of means.

3. **Understand Interactions:**

   - Interactions can be tricky to interpret. When significant, they tell us that "it depends" - the effect of one variable depends on the level of another variable.

4. **APA Formatting:**

   - Pay attention to proper APA formatting: italicize F, p, and η²; report exact p-values (unless p < .001); include degrees of freedom.
   - Example: F(1, 54) = 6.59, p = .013, partial η² = .11

5. **Connect to Research Questions:**
   - Always circle back to the original research questions. Do your results provide clear answers to these questions?
