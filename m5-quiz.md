Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
The data file contains data on city schools and suburb schools, their religious affiliation (yes or no), and the percentage of their graduates going to college. Run a 2x2 two-way ANOVA to examine whether community type (city vs suburb) and religious affiliation (yes or no) have any effect on percentage of graduates going to college, and whether the two factors (community type and religious affiliation) interact with each other.

What is the omnibus F statistic? (Enter the number and keep all the decimal places provided by SPSS)

Quiz Instructions
Instruction:

Students are allowed two attempts on the quiz by the due date. The higher score will be used toward the calculation of the final grade.
The questions are randomly drawn from a question bank for each attempt, so the two attempts may not have identical questions.
The quiz is open-book/open-note, to be completed in 90 minutes. Once you start this quiz, you must finish it in one sitting because the timer does not stop if you leave the quiz.
The quiz covers the concepts from the readings and video lectures in this module, but may touch on concepts from previous modules.
Note: this is a timed quiz. You may check the remaining time you have at any point while taking the quiz by pressing the keyboard combination SHIFT, ALT, and T... Again: SHIFT, ALT, and T...

Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
The owners of the Syfy channel are interested in whether watching the Syfy channel causes people to become "geeky," and if so, whether any such effects depend on a person's gender. They hire a researcher to design and carry out the appropriate study. The researcher randomly assigns an equal number of men and women to watch 0, 3, 5, or 9 hours of the Syfy channel each week for 6 weeks. What is the research hypothesis for the main effect of hours watched?
Group of answer choices

On average, watchers are equally geeky regardless of the hours of the Syfy channel they watch.

On average, men are geekier than women when watching fewer hours but less geeky than women when watching more hours of the Syfy channel.

On average, watchers differ in their geekiness levels across the various hours of the Syfy channel watched.

On average, men and women differ in their geekiness levels.

Question 91 pts
Roediger and Karpicke (2006) investigated whether the test-enhanced learning effect (the demonstration that repeated testing improves memory for material) was due merely to repeated exposure to material. They randomly assigned participants to one of two study conditions (study-study or study-test) and to one of three retention interval conditions (final test at a delay of 5 minutes, 2 days, or 1 week). The dependent variable was the proportion of idea units recalled from an encyclopedia passage. How should the analysis of these data be labeled?
