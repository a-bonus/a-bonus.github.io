# M4 Assignment Guide: Thinking Through ANOVA Analyses

This guide helps you navigate the M4 assignment, focusing on the _why_ behind the steps in ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA. It encourages you to think critically about the process and interpret results thoughtfully. Use the hints provided to steer you in the right direction in SPSS and your interpretations.

**Goal:** To develop your understanding and application of ANOVA techniques by actively engaging with the data and research questions.

**General Principles:**

- Always consider the research question first. What are you trying to find out?
- Understand the assumptions of each test. Why are they important?
- Don't just report numbers; interpret what they mean in the context of the research question.
- APA format requires specific conventions – pay attention to italics, p-value reporting, etc.

## Part 1: Data Preparation (Q1 & Q2 Dataset)

**Objective:** Correctly set up your SPSS data file from the provided Excel sheet. Accurate setup is crucial for valid analyses.

**Process:**

1.  **Import:** Import the data from the first worksheet (sheet) of the Excel file into SPSS.

    - `Hint:` SPSS has a dedicated function for importing data directly from Excel files under the `File` menu. Ensure variable names are read correctly.

2.  **Configure Variables:** Switch to SPSS's "Variable View". This is where you define your data structure.

    - **Measure Type:** For each variable, consider what kind of data it represents (categorical, continuous ranking, continuous measurement). Assign the appropriate "Measure" level (`Nominal`, `Ordinal`, or `Scale`).

      - `Think:` What distinguishes `Nominal`, `Ordinal`, and `Scale` measures? Refer to the Codebook.

      ![SPSS Measure Types](/assets/m4-assets/measures.png)

    - **Value Labels:** For categorical variables (`Marital`, `Employment Status`, `EducR`), numeric codes are used in the data. You need to tell SPSS what these codes mean.

      - `Hint:` The "Values" column in Variable View is where you link numeric codes (like `1`) to their text labels (like `"Married"`). Consult the Codebook for the correct codes and labels.

## Part 2: Question 1 - One-Way ANOVA (Education & Executive Function)

**Research Question:** Does executive function (EF1) seem to differ based on educational attainment (EducR)?

### A. Hypotheses and Variables

- **Identify:** What is the outcome measure being influenced (Dependent Variable, DV)? What variable defines the groups being compared (Independent Variable, IV)?
- **Null Hypothesis (*H*₀):** Formulate a statement indicating no significant difference in the dependent variable across the levels of the independent variable. The null hypothesis should state that the means are equal across all groups.

### B. Assumption Check: Homogeneity of Variances

- **Concept:** ANOVA assumes the variability (variance) of the dependent variable is roughly similar within each group defined by the independent variable. Why is this important? If the variances are very different, the F-test's p-value might not be accurate, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the equality of means.

- **Test:** Use SPSS to perform Levene's test for homogeneity of variances.

  - `Hint:` This option is usually found within the main `One-Way ANOVA` procedure settings (`Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Way ANOVA`). Look under `Options`.

  ![One-Way ANOVA Dialog](/assets/m4-assets/one-way-anova.png)

  ![ANOVA DV](/assets/m4-assets/anova-dv.png)

  - `Hint:` Consider which variable represents the outcome you're measuring and which variable defines the groups being compared. The dependent list should contain the outcome variable, while the factor should be the grouping variable.

- **Interpretation:**

  1.  Locate Levene's test result (specifically the p-value, often labeled "Sig.") in your SPSS output.

  ![Levene's Test](/assets/m4-assets/levene-sig.png)

  2.  Compare this p-value to the standard alpha level (α = 0.05).
      - If _p_ > 0.05: Levene's test is _not_ significant. This means the variances are _not significantly different_. We conclude that the assumption of homogeneity of variances is met. (Example: If _p_ = 0.6, you would say "Levene's test was not significant (_p_ = .60), indicating homogeneity of variances can be assumed.")
      - If _p_ ≤ 0.05: Levene's test _is_ significant. This means the variances _are significantly different_. We conclude that the assumption of homogeneity of variances is violated.
  3.  `Think:` Why does a _non-significant_ result for Levene's test support proceeding with the standard ANOVA? Because it means the data does _not_ provide strong evidence against the assumption that variances are equal.

- **Action:** Paste the relevant Levene's test output table and state your conclusion about whether the assumption is met or violated in your assignment.

### C. Main ANOVA Results

- **Perform Test:** Run the One-Way ANOVA in SPSS using the appropriate variables for your analysis.
- **Locate Key Statistics:** In the main ANOVA table of your output, find the F-statistic, degrees of freedom (df - there are two: between-groups and within-groups/error), and the p-value (Sig.).

![ANOVA Results](/assets/m4-assets/anova-results.png)

- **Effect Size (η²):** Determine the practical significance using eta squared (η²). How much of the variance in EF1 is associated with EducR? Calculate η² = SS_between / SS_total (where SS stands for Sum of Squares from the ANOVA table).

  - `Think:` Effect size helps us understand the magnitude of the difference, not just whether a statistically significant difference exists.
  - Benchmarks for η² (eta squared):
    - 0.01 = small effect (~1% of variance explained)
    - 0.06 = medium effect (~6% of variance explained)
    - 0.14 = large effect (~14% of variance explained)

- **Report in APA Format:** Present the results concisely using standard APA symbols and format (e.g., _F_(df*between, df_within) = [F-value], \_p* = [p-value], η² = [eta-squared value]).
  - `Think:` Are the symbols correctly italicized? Is the p-value reported exactly (e.g., _p_ = .034) or as _p_ < .001 if very small? Is η² reported?
- **Action:** Paste the relevant ANOVA output table(s) to support your reported statistics.

### D. Decision and Conclusion

- **Decision:** Based on the p-value from the main ANOVA test (Part C) and α = 0.05, decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis (*H*₀). Justify your decision by comparing the p-value to alpha.

  - If _p_ ≤ 0.05: Reject *H*₀. There is a statistically significant difference between the group means (e.g., between the levels of your independent variable for your dependent variable).
  - If _p_ > 0.05: Fail to reject *H*₀. There is no statistically significant difference between the group means (e.g., between the levels of your independent variable for your dependent variable).

- **Conclusion:** `Hint:` When writing your conclusion, remember to:
  1. State whether there was or wasn't a significant difference
  2. Include the specific variables involved
  3. Report the key statistics (F-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value)
  4. Use proper APA formatting for statistical notation
  5. Connect back to the original research question about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables

### E. Post Hoc Analysis (Conditional)

- **Necessity:** `Think:` When are post-hoc tests needed after an ANOVA?

  - Condition 1: Was the overall ANOVA significant (_p_ ≤ 0.05)?
  - Condition 2: Does your independent variable (Factor) have _more than two_ groups (levels)?
  - If _both_ conditions are true, post-hoc tests are needed to determine _which specific groups_ differ significantly from each other. If the overall ANOVA is not significant, or if you only have two groups, post-hoc tests are generally not performed.

- **If Necessary:**

  1.  Choose an appropriate test based on the Homogeneity of Variances assumption (Part B):
      - If variances are equal (Levene's _p_ > .05), choose a test that assumes equal variances.
      - If variances are unequal (Levene's _p_ ≤ .05), choose a test that does not assume equal variances.

  ![Post-Hoc Tests](/assets/m4-assets/post-hoc.png)

  - `Hint:` Post-hoc tests are selected within the `One-Way ANOVA` dialog box under the `Post Hoc...` button.

  2.  Interpret the "Multiple Comparisons" output table. Look at the "Sig." column for each pairwise comparison. Which specific group pairs show a significant difference (_p_ ≤ .05)? Report which group means are significantly higher or lower than others.

- **If Not Necessary:** Explain _why_ post-hoc tests were not needed (e.g., "The overall ANOVA was not significant," or "The independent variable only had two groups"). Proceed to Part F.

### F. Graphing

- **Visualize:** Create a graph to visually represent the mean executive function scores for each educational group. This helps in understanding the pattern of results, especially if the ANOVA was significant.
- **Create Graph:** Use SPSS to generate a bar chart showing the mean of the dependent variable for each group of the independent variable.
  - `Hint:` `Graphs -> Chart Builder` is flexible. Drag the IV to the X-axis and the DV to the Y-axis (ensure the summary statistic is set to display the Mean). `Graphs -> Legacy Dialogs -> Bar -> Simple` (or `Line -> Simple`) is another option.
- **Action:** Paste the graph into your assignment. Ensure it has clear axis labels (including variable names) and a descriptive title.

## Part 3: Question 2 - Another One-Way ANOVA (Employment & Age)

**Research Question:** Is there an association between employment status and age at the start of the study?

Follow the logic from Question 1 (Parts A-D), applying it to the new variables:

- **A. Hypotheses & Variables:** Define the IV and DV. Formulate the null hypothesis (*H*₀) for this specific question.
- **B. Assumption Check:** Run and interpret Levene's test for homogeneity of variances for the DV across the IV groups. State whether the assumption is met. Paste the table.
- **C. Main ANOVA Results:** Run the ANOVA with the DV and Factor. Report _F_, df, _p_, and η² in APA format. Paste the ANOVA table(s).
- **D. Decision & Conclusion:** Make a decision about *H*₀ based on the p-value. Answer the research question about whether mean age differs significantly between employment statuses.
- `Think:` Does this ANOVA require post-hoc tests? Why or why not? (Consider the number of groups in the IV. Refer back to Q1 Part E logic).

---

## Part 4: Data Preparation (Q3 Dataset)

**Objective:** Import and prepare the dataset for the repeated measures analysis.

**Process:**

1.  **Import:** Load the data from the "Q3data" worksheet (sheet 3) of the Excel file into a _new_ SPSS data editor window or clear your existing data/variables first.
2.  **Check Variables:** Go to "Variable View".
    - What "Measure" type is appropriate for the memory scores in each session? (`Hint:` They are likely continuous measurements).
3.  **Save:** Save this new SPSS data file (.sav) with a distinct name (e.g., `q3_data.sav`) - you will need to upload this file as well.

---

## Part 5: Question 3 - One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA (Session & Memory Score)

**Research Question:** Does memory performance change significantly across the three testing sessions?

**Concept:** We're now comparing means from the _same_ individuals measured at multiple time points (a within-subjects design).

### A. Assumption Check: Sphericity

- **Concept:** Repeated measures ANOVA has a specific assumption called sphericity. It assumes that the variances of the _differences_ between scores for all pairs of within-subjects levels (e.g., Session 1 vs Session 2, Session 2 vs Session 3, Session 1 vs Session 3) are approximately equal. Mauchly's test evaluates this assumption.
- **Test:** Perform the Repeated Measures ANOVA in SPSS.

  - `Hint:` This is found under `Analyze -> General Linear Model -> Repeated Measures`.

  ![Repeated Measures Dialog](/assets/m4-assets/repeated-measures.png)

  - **Important:** Ensure you are using the data imported from the Q3data worksheet for this analysis.

  - You first need to define your within-subjects factor. In the `Within-Subject Factor Name` box, type a name (e.g., `session` or `time`). In the `Number of Levels` box, enter the number of repeated measurements (here, 3). Click `Add`, then `Define`.

  ![Repeated Measures Levels](/assets/m4-assets/repeated-measures-levels.png)

  - In the next dialog, assign the variables corresponding to each level of your within-subjects factor (`Session1_Score`, `Session2_Score`, `Session3_Score`) to the `Within-Subjects Variables` slots in the correct order.

- **Interpretation:**

  1.  Find Mauchly's Test of Sphericity in the output tables. Look at the p-value (Sig.).

  ![Mauchly's Test](/assets/m4-assets/sphericity.png)

  2.  Compare the p-value to α = 0.05.
  3.  `Think:` Consider what the null hypothesis represents in Mauchly's test of sphericity.
      - If _p_ > 0.05: Mauchly's test is _not_ significant. This means there is no significant evidence _against_ sphericity. We conclude the assumption of sphericity is met.
      - If _p_ ≤ 0.05: Mauchly's test _is_ significant. This means the variances of the differences are significantly different. We conclude the assumption of sphericity is violated.
      - This logic is similar to Levene's test: a non-significant result supports the assumption.

- **Action:** Paste the Mauchly's test table and state whether the assumption of sphericity is met or violated based on the p-value.

### B. Main Repeated Measures ANOVA Results

- **Enable Effect Size:** Before running the analysis, you need to ensure SPSS will calculate and display effect size statistics.

  - `Hint:` In the main `Repeated Measures` dialog box (after defining your within-subjects factor and assigning variables), click the `Options` button. In the "Repeated Measures: Options" window, check the box for `Estimates of effect size`. This is crucial - if you don't check this option, the Partial Eta Squared column will not appear in your output tables.

  - **Important:** You must check this option BEFORE clicking `OK` to run the analysis. If you've already run the analysis without checking this option, you'll need to re-run it with the option enabled.

- **Locate Key Table:** Find the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table in your output.

![Within-Subjects Effects](/assets/m4-assets/within-subjects.png)

- **Critical Step - Choose the Right Row:** Your interpretation depends on the Mauchly's test result from Part A.

  - If Sphericity Met (Mauchly's _p_ > .05): Use the results in the row labeled "Sphericity Assumed".
  - If Sphericity Violated (Mauchly's _p_ ≤ .05): Use the results from a corrected row. `Hint:` The Greenhouse-Geisser correction is commonly reported and robust. Look at the row labeled "Greenhouse-Geisser". Note that the degrees of freedom (df) values might be adjusted (non-integers) in this corrected row.

- **Identify Statistics:** From the _correct_ row (either "Sphericity Assumed" or "Greenhouse-Geisser"), extract the F-statistic, the two df values (factor df and error df), the p-value (Sig.), and the Partial Eta Squared (ηₚ² - this is the standard effect size reported for RM ANOVA).

  - `Important:` Partial Eta Squared (ηₚ²) appears in the **rightmost column** of the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table. You do NOT need to calculate this manually - SPSS provides it directly in the output when you have "Estimates of effect size" enabled. The value will be listed in the row corresponding to your within-subjects factor (e.g., "Memory" or "session").

  - `Note:` In repeated measures ANOVA, the terminology differs from between-subjects ANOVA. The table shows your factor name (e.g., "Memory") and "Error(Memory)" - these correspond to the factor effect and error term, respectively. The Partial Eta Squared value you need is found in the row for your factor (e.g., "Memory"), not in the Error row.

- **Report in APA Format:** Present these statistics using the correct format and symbols (e.g., _F_(df*factor, df_error) = [F-value], \_p* = [p-value], ηₚ² = [partial eta-squared value]). Ensure your reported df match the row you chose based on the sphericity test.

- **Action:** Paste the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table into your assignment. Clearly indicate which row (Sphericity Assumed or Greenhouse-Geisser) you are using for your interpretation based on Mauchly's test.

### C. Answer the Research Question

- **Decision:** Based on the p-value from your chosen row in the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table (Part B) and α = 0.05, decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis (*H*₀: the mean scores are equal across all sessions).
- **Conclusion:** Answer the research question. State your conclusion clearly, referencing the statistical results (e.g., "There was a statistically significant effect of session on color memory performance, _F_(...) = ..., _p_ = ..., ηₚ² = ....").

### D. Analyze Contrasts

- **Concept:** If the overall Repeated Measures ANOVA is significant (from Part B/C), contrasts can help pinpoint _where_ the significant differences occur between specific sessions. "Simple" contrasts compare each level (session) to a reference level (either the first or the last session).

- **Perform Contrasts (if needed/requested):** Contrasts are often requested as part of the main Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis.

  - `Hint:` In the main `Repeated Measures` dialog box (where you assigned the session variables), click the `Contrasts` button. Select your within-subjects factor (`session`) from the list. Change the `Contrast` type drop-down menu to `Simple`. Click `Change`.

  ![Contrasts](/assets/m4-assets/contrasts.png)

- **Interpret:**
  1.  Examine the "Tests of Within-Subjects Contrasts" table in the output. This table specifically tests the hypotheses defined by the contrast type you selected (e.g., Simple contrast with first level as reference).
  2.  For each comparison listed (e.g., Level 2 vs. Level 1, Level 3 vs. Level 1), look at the corresponding row for your factor (`session`) and find the p-value (Sig.).
  3.  `Think:` Which specific session comparisons show a statistically significant difference (_p_ ≤ .05)? What does this tell you about how memory performance changed between specific time points (e.g., was there a significant improvement between Session 1 and Session 2)?
- **Action:** Paste the "Tests of Within-Subjects Contrasts" table. Discuss your observations about which specific session-to-session changes were statistically significant, citing the relevant p-values for each comparison you discuss.
