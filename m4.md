# M4 Assignment Guide: Thinking Through ANOVA Analyses

This guide helps you navigate the M4 assignment, focusing on the *why* behind the steps in ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA. It encourages you to think critically about the process and interpret results thoughtfully. Use the hints provided to steer you in the right direction in SPSS and your interpretations.

**Goal:** To develop your understanding and application of ANOVA techniques by actively engaging with the data and research questions.

**General Principles:**
* Always consider the research question first. What are you trying to find out?
* Understand the assumptions of each test. Why are they important?
* Don't just report numbers; interpret what they mean in the context of the research question.
* APA format requires specific conventions – pay attention to italics, p-value reporting, etc.

## Part 1: Data Preparation (Q1 & Q2 Dataset)

**Objective:** Correctly set up your SPSS data file from the provided Excel sheet. Accurate setup is crucial for valid analyses.

**Process:**

1. **Import:** Import the data from the first 'page' of the Excel file into SPSS.
   * `Hint:` SPSS has a dedicated function for importing data directly from Excel files under the `File` menu. Ensure variable names are read correctly.

2. **Configure Variables:** Switch to SPSS's "Variable View". This is where you define your data structure.
   * **Measure Type:** For each variable, consider what kind of data it represents (categorical, continuous ranking, continuous measurement). Assign the appropriate "Measure" level.
     * `Think:` What distinguishes `Nominal`, `Ordinal`, and `Scale` measures? Refer to the Codebook.
     
     ![SPSS Measure Types](/assets/m4-assets/measures.png)
     
   * **Value Labels:** For categorical variables (`Marital`, `Employment Status`, `EducR`), numeric codes are used in the data. You need to tell SPSS what these codes mean.
     * `Hint:` The "Values" column in Variable View is where you link numeric codes (like `1`) to their text labels (like `"Married"`). Consult the Codebook for the correct codes and labels.

## Part 2: Question 1 - One-Way ANOVA (Education & Executive Function)

**Research Question:** Does executive function (EF1) seem to differ based on educational attainment (EducR)?

### A. Hypotheses and Variables

* **Identify:** What is the outcome measure being influenced (DV)? What variable defines the groups being compared (IV)?
* **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Formulate the statement of "there is no difference" or "there is no relationship" between your IV and DV in the context of this research question. Remember, ANOVA tests if group *means* are equal. An example null hypothesis would be: "There is no difference in executive function (EF1) for varying educational levels (EducR)."

### B. Assumption Check: Homogeneity of Variances

* **Concept:** ANOVA assumes the variability (variance) within each group is roughly similar. Why is this important for comparing means? 

If the variances are not similar, the ANOVA test may not be valid because it will be sensitive to the variability in the data, meaning the results may not generalize to the population. 

Practically, if the variances are not similar, the ANOVA test may not be sensitive to the differences between the groups, meaning the results may not be reliable. 

* **Test:** Use SPSS to perform Levene's test for homogeneity of variances.
  * `Hint:` This option is usually found within the main `One-Way ANOVA` procedure settings (`Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Way ANOVA`). Look under `Options`.

  ![One-Way ANOVA Dialog](/assets/m4-assets/one-way-anova.png)

  ![ANOVA DV](/assets/m4-assets/anova-dv.png)

  You're probably wondering what goes in the dependent list and what's a factor. The dependent list is the variable you're measuring, and the factor is the variable that defines the groups you're comparing. What would that mean in this case? Hint: the dependent variable is the one that measures the outcome, and the factor is the one that defines the groups.

* **Interpretation:**
  1. Locate Levene's test result (specifically the p-value, often labeled "Sig.") in your SPSS output.

  ![Levene's Test](/assets/m4-assets/levene-sig.png)

  2. Compare this p-value to the standard alpha level (α = 0.05). So for example, if you had a p-value of 0.6, you would say "The Levene's test was not significant, because 0.6 > 0.05 or p > 0.05." If the levene's test is not significant, then we can assume that the variances are equal, and we can proceed with the ANOVA test. Why does it sound like we're saying the opposite of what we want? We're practically saying that the variances are not significantly different, and that we can assume that they are equal, and that we can proceed with the ANOVA test.

  3. `Think:` What does it mean if Levene's test is sigificant (p ≤ .05) versus non-significant (p > .05) regarding the ANOVA assumption? Re-read the explanation above.

* **Action:** Paste the relevant output table and state your conclusion about the assumption in your assignment. 

### C. Main ANOVA Results

* **Perform Test:** Run the One-Way ANOVA in SPSS using `EF1` as the DV and `EducR` as the Factor/IV.
* **Locate Key Statistics:** In the main ANOVA table of your output, find the F-statistic, degrees of freedom (df - there are two!), and the p-value (Sig.).

![ANOVA Results](/assets/m4-assets/anova-results.png)

* **Effect Size (η²):** We're looking at the point estimate of the effect size eta squared. Determine the practical significance. How much of the variance in EF1 is associated with EducR?
  * `Think:` Effect size helps us understand the magnitude of the difference, not just whether a difference exists.
  * Benchmarks for η² (eta squared):
    - 0.01 = small effect (1% of variance explained)
    - 0.06 = medium effect (6% of variance explained)
    - 0.14 = large effect (14% of variance explained)

* **Report in APA Format:** Present the results concisely using standard APA symbols and format (e.g., *F*(df1, df2) = ..., *p* = ..., η² = ...).
  * `Think:` Are the symbols correctly italicized? Is the p-value reported exactly?
* **Action:** Paste the relevant ANOVA output table(s) to support your reported statistics. 

### D. Decision and Conclusion

* **Decision:** Based on the p-value from the main ANOVA test (Part C) and α = 0.05, decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀). Justify your decision.

For example if you had a p-value of 0.04, you would say "The ANOVA was significant, because 0.04 < 0.05 or p < 0.05." If the ANOVA is significant, then we can reject the null hypothesis, and we can say that there is a significant difference between the groups. If p > 0.05, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and we can say that there is no significant difference between the groups.

* **Conclusion:** Translate your statistical decision back into a clear answer to the original research question about executive function and education level. This is where you would say something like "There was a significant difference in executive function (EF1) between educational levels (EducR)." You're basically just restating the null hypothesis in a way that is easy to understand.

### E. Post Hoc Analysis (Conditional)

* **Necessity:** `Think:` When are post-hoc tests actually needed after an ANOVA? 

Consider two factors: 1) Was the overall ANOVA significant? 2) How many groups does your IV have?
Why is it important to consider both of these factors? The post hoc analysis is only needed if the overall ANOVA is significant and if there are more than two groups in the IV. If the overall ANOVA is not significant, then we don't need to perform the post hoc analysis. If there are only two groups in the IV, then we don't need to perform the post hoc analysis.

* **If Necessary:**
  1. Choose an appropriate test (e.g., Tukey if variances are equal, Games-Howell if unequal - remember Levene's test result!). You still need to choose the appropriate test based on the Levene's test result, whether variances are equal or unequal.

  ![Post-Hoc Tests](/assets/m4-assets/post-hoc.png)

  * `Hint:` Post-hoc tests are selected within the `One-Way ANOVA` dialog box.

  2. Interpret the "Multiple Comparisons" output table. Which specific group pairs show a significant difference (p ≤ .05)? Basically, look at the p-values in the table and see which ones are less than 0.05, a group pair is presented in the table, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 2 and 3. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then we can say that there is a significant difference between the group pair.

* **If Not Necessary:** Proceed to Part F.

### F. Graphing (Conditional)

* **Necessity:** If post-hoc tests were *not* required (based on your reasoning in Part E), visualize the group means. 
* **Create Graph:** Use SPSS to generate a bar or line graph showing the mean of the dependent variable for each group of the independent variable.
  * `Hint:` `Graphs -> Chart Builder` is flexible. Drag the IV to the X-axis and the DV to the Y-axis (ensure it's set to display the Mean). `Legacy Dialogs` are another option.
* **Action:** Paste the graph, ensuring it has clear labels and a title, that's it.

## Part 3: Question 2 - Another One-Way ANOVA (Employment & Age)

**Research Question:** Is there an association between employment status (employed/unemployed) and age (age1) at the start of the study?

Follow the logic from Question 1 (Parts A-D), applying it to the new variables:

* **A. Hypotheses & Variables:** Define for this specific question.
* **B. Assumption Check:** Run and interpret Levene's test again. 
* **C. Main ANOVA Results:** Run the ANOVA. Report F, df, p, and η² in APA format. Paste table(s).
* **D. Decision & Conclusion:** Make a decision about H₀ based on the p-value. Answer the research question about age and employment status.
* `Think:` Does this ANOVA require post-hoc tests? Why or why not? (Relates back to Q1 Part E logic).

## Part 4: Data Preparation (Q3 Dataset)

**Objective:** Import and prepare the dataset for the repeated measures analysis.

**Process:**

1. **Import:** Load the data from the "Q3data" worksheet ('page' 3) of the Excel file into a *new* or clean SPSS session.
2. **Check Variables:** Go to "Variable View". What "Measure" type is appropriate for the memory scores in each session? Are Value Labels needed here?
3. **Save:** Save this new SPSS data file (.sav) with a distinct name - you will upload this also. 

---

## Part 5: Question 3 - One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA (Session & Memory Score)

**Research Question:** Does color memory performance change significantly across the three testing sessions?

**Concept:** We're now comparing means from the *same* individuals measured at multiple time points (within-subjects design).

### A. Assumption Check: Sphericity

* **Concept:** Repeated measures ANOVA has a specific assumption called sphericity, related to the variances of the differences between conditions. Mauchly's test evaluates this.
* **Test:** Perform the Repeated Measures ANOVA in SPSS.
  * `Hint:` This is found under `Analyze -> General Linear Model -> Repeated Measures`. 

    ![Repeated Measures Dialog](/assets/m4-assets/repeated-measures.png)

  Very important: Make sure you re-import the data from the Q3data worksheet again. 

  You'll need to define your within-subjects factor (e.g., `session`, with 3 levels) and then assign the corresponding variables (`Session1_Score`, `Session2_Score`, `Session3_Score`) to the defined slots.

  ![Repeated Measures Levels](/assets/m4-assets/repeated-measures-levels.png)

* **Interpretation:**
  1. Find Mauchly's Test of Sphericity in the output. Look at the p-value (Sig.).

  ![Mauchly's Test](/assets/m4-assets/mauchly-test.png)

  2. Compare p-value to α = 0.05.
  3. `Think:` The null hypothesis for Mauchly's test is that sphericity *holds*. What does a significant (p ≤ .05) or non-significant (p > .05) result mean for this assumption? This is similar to the Levene's test in the previous parts - think critically about what this means.

* **Action:** Paste the Mauchly's test table and state whether the assumption is met or violated. Use the same logic as the Levene's test in the previous parts.

### B. Main Repeated Measures ANOVA Results

* **Locate Key Table:** Find the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table in your output.

![Within-Subjects Effects](/assets/m4-assets/within-subjects.png)

* **Critical Step - Choose the Right Row:** Your interpretation depends on the Mauchly's test result from Part A.
  * If Sphericity Met (Mauchly's p > .05): Use the "Sphericity Assumed" row.
  * If Sphericity Violated (Mauchly's p ≤ .05): Use a corrected row. `Hint:` The Greenhouse-Geisser correction is commonly used and robust. Note how the df values might change.

* **Identify Statistics:** From the *correct* row, extract the F-statistic, the two df values, the p-value (Sig.), and the Partial Eta Squared (ηₚ² - a common effect size for RM ANOVA).

* **Report in APA Format:** Present these statistics using the correct format and symbols. Ensure your reported df match the row you chose (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser dfs).

* **Action:** Paste the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table.  

### C. Answer the Research Question

* **Decision:** Based on the p-value from your chosen row in the "Tests of Within-Subjects Effects" table (Part B), decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis (that mean scores are equal across all sessions).
* **Conclusion:** Answer the research question about whether color memory performance changed significantly across the sessions.

### D. Analyze Contrasts

* **Concept:** Even if the overall ANOVA isn't significant, specific comparisons between sessions might be, look at the contrasts table and the p-values. 

Contrasts test these specific hypotheses. "Simple" contrasts compare each level to a reference level (first or last).

* **Perform Contrasts:** If you didn't request them initially, re-run the Repeated Measures ANOVA and request the contrasts when you run the analysis.

  * `Hint:` Use the `Contrasts` button in the Repeated Measures dialog. Select your within-subjects factor 

    ![Contrasts](/assets/m4-assets/contrasts.png)

  (`session`) and choose the `Simple` contrast type. You need to specify whether the `First` or `Last` category is the reference point for comparison (the key seems to use `First`).

* **Interpret:**
  1. Examine the "Tests of Within-Subjects Contrasts" table.
  2. For each comparison listed (e.g., Level 2 vs. Level 1), look at the p-value (Sig.).
  3. `Think:` Which specific session comparisons show a statistically significant difference (p ≤ .05)? What does this imply about practice effects or changes between specific sessions?
* **Action:** Paste the contrasts table and discuss your observations, citing the specific p-values for each comparison you discuss.
