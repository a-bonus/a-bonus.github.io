Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
Background: The data set contains data collected from high schools in different community types: city, suburb, and town/rural areas.

The researcher would like to know if there is a significant difference in the percentage of graduates going to college across the three geographic locations (city, suburb, and town/rural). Perform a one-way ANOVA to answer this question.

Quiz Instructions
Instruction:

Students are allowed two attempts on the quiz by the due date. The higher score will be used toward the calculation of the final grade.
The questions are randomly drawn from a question bank for each attempt, so the two attempts may not have identical questions.
The quiz is open-book/open-note, to be completed in 90 minutes. Once you start this quiz, you must finish it in one sitting because the timer does not stop if you leave the quiz.
The quiz covers the concepts from the readings and video lectures in this module, but may touch on concepts from previous modules.
Note: this is a timed quiz. You may check the remaining time you have at any point while taking the quiz by pressing the keyboard combination SHIFT, ALT, and T... Again: SHIFT, ALT, and T...

Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
Which statement accurately captures why within-groups designs are preferred over between-groups designs?
Group of answer choices

Loss of participants has a more significant negative impact on between-groups designs as compared to within-groups designs.

Control of extraneous variables is easier when using between-groups designs than within-groups designs.

Within-groups designs take less time than between-groups designs.

Variability due to participants' differences is held constant across levels of the independent variable in the within-groups design, resulting in less within-groups variability.

Flag question: Question 2
Question 21 pts
If an F statistic is negative, which of these is true?
Group of answer choices

The difference among the group means is less than what would have occurred by chance.

The difference among the group means is greater than what would have occurred by chance.

The within-groups variance exceeds the between-groups variance.

There has been a calculation error.

Flag question: Question 3
Question 31 pts
Within-groups degrees of freedom is calculated by \_\_\_\_.
Group of answer choices

subtracting 1 from the total number of groups in the study

multiplying the number of subjects by the number of conditions in the study and then subtracting 1

for each condition, subtracting 1 from the number of subjects in that group and then adding together the totals for all the groups

subtracting 1 from the total number of subjects in the study

Flag question: Question 4
Question 41 pts
A researcher can't just run multiple t tests when the independent variable has more than two levels because as more statistical tests are run, \_\_\_.
Group of answer choices

degrees of freedom are lost

the probability of making a Type I error in one of the tests increases

it becomes harder and harder to reject the null hypothesis

the probability of making a Type II error in one of the tests increases

Flag question: Question 5
Question 51 pts
The t and F distributions have something in commonâ€”the numerator of the test statistic \_\_\_.
Group of answer choices

represents what would be expected to happen by chance

contains a measure of variability within the various groups

is a squared number

contains a measure of difference among group means

Flag question: Question 6
Question 61 pts
Between-groups degrees of freedom is calculated by \_\_\_.
Group of answer choices

subtracting 1 from the number of subjects within each group and then adding those numbers together

multiplying the number of subjects by the number of conditions in the study and then subtracting 1

subtracting 1 from the total number of subjects in the study

subtracting 1 from the total number of groups in the study

Flag question: Question 7
Question 71 pts
Lucille is interested in the effects of alcohol consumption on style of play while playing the video game The Sims. She asks a group of 15 college students to play The Sims under one of the following conditions: no alcohol, 1 ounce of alcohol, 2 ounces of alcohol, or 3 ounces of alcohol. Lucille measures on a scale of 1 to 10 how prosocial the students' style of play is. After collecting the data, Lucille performs an ANOVA and finds that she can reject the null hypothesis. On this basis, what does Lucille know?
Group of answer choices

She knows that greater levels of alcohol consumption are associated with a more prosocial style of play.

She knows that drinking any amount of alcohol affects the style of play.

She knows that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with prosocial play, but that greater alcohol consumption is associated with an antisocial style of play.

She knows that there is a difference among the groups somewhere, but she does not know where.

Flag question: Question 9
Question 91 pts
In which situation would it be necessary to use a within-groups ANOVA?

A researcher interested in the effects of distraction on driving performance randomly assigns participants to one of three distraction groups.

A researcher is interested in whether a sensitivity training class changes attitudes toward minority populations. The researcher assesses these attitudes in participants who have and have not had the sensitivity training class.

A researcher classifies a group of college students on the basis of their political leanings as liberal, conservative, libertarian, or green.
