There is no limit on the number of attempts allowed
Use alpha = .05 for all hypothesis tests

Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
Background: An experiment was conducted to examine the potential effect of a new drug for treating blood pressure. Participants were assigned randomly into either the treatment group or the control group, and their blood pressure was measured before and after the experiment.

Import Q1 data into SPSS for questions 1 to 5. Perform an independent-samples t-test to find out whether the treatment group and the control group ("Treatment" variable) differ significantly in blood pressure before the experiment ("Before_BP" variable).

What is the p value for the Levene's test? Report the exact p value from SPSS output, with all the decimal places. (If the p value fro SPSS is .000, report the value as <.001 according to the APA format.)

Flag question: Question 2
Question 21 pts
Is the assumption of equal variances met? How do you know?
Group of answer choices

No, the assumption is not met because the p value is lower than the alpha level.

Yes, the assumption is met because the p value is lower than the alpha level.

Yes, the assumption is met because the p value is higher than the alpha level.

No, the assumption is not met because the p value is higher than the alpha level.

Flag question: Question 3
Question 31 pts
What is the t-statistic? Report the exact t-value from SPSS output. Remember to consider the Levene's test result so you will report the correct t-statistic.

Flag question: Question 4
Question 41 pts
What is the p-value of the t-test? Report the exact p-value from the SPSS output, with all the decimal places. (If the p-value from SPSS is .000, report the value as "<.001" for the answer.)

Flag question: Question 5
Question 51 pts
What is the conclusion of the t-test and what is the rationale?
Group of answer choices

There is a significant difference in Before_BP because p is higher than alpha.

There is no significant difference in Before_BP because p is higher than alpha.

There is a significant difference in Before_BP because p is lower than alpha.

There is no significant difference in Before_BP because p is lower than alpha.

.433

.679

Flag question: Question 7
Question 71 pts
Import Q2 data into SPSS for questions 6 to 10. Q2 data sheet contains data from only the treatment group. Perform a paired-samples t test to find out whether there is a significant difference between the before-experiment and after-experiment blood pressure.("Before_BP" vs "After_BP").

What is the t statistic for the t-test? Report the exact t-value from SPSS output, with all the decimal places.

Flag question: Question 8
Question 81 pts
What is the p-value for the t-test? Report the exact p-value from SPSS output, with all the decimal places. (If the p-value from SPSS is .000, report the value as "<.001" for the answer.)

Flag question: Question 9
Question 91 pts
Which statement is the correct decision based on the t-test result?
Group of answer choices

Blood pressure changed significantly because the p value is higher than alpha.

Blood pressure did not change significantly because the p value is lower than alpha.

Blood pressure changed significantly after experiment because the p value is lower than alpha.

Blood pressure did not change significantly because the p value is higher than alpha.

Flag question: Question 10
Question 101 pts
What is the effect size from this t-test? Round the answer to two decimal places.

Quiz Instructions
Instruction:

Students are allowed two attempts on the quiz by the due date. The higher score will be used toward the calculation of the final grade.
The questions are randomly drawn from a question bank for each attempt, so the two attempts may not have identical questions.
The quiz is open-book/open-note, to be completed in 90 minutes. Once you start this quiz, you must finish it in one sitting because the timer does not stop if you leave the quiz.
The quiz covers the concepts from the readings and video lectures in this module but may also touch on concepts from previous modules.
Note: this is a timed quiz. You may check the remaining time you have at any point while taking the quiz by pressing the keyboard combination SHIFT, ALT, and T... Again: SHIFT, ALT, and T...

Flag question: Question 1
Question 11 pts
Researchers were interested in whether relaxation training works better than fitness training in decreasing the number of headaches a person experiences. They randomly assigned 20 participants either to the fitness training group or a relaxation training group and then recorded the change in number of headaches for each group from pre-training to post-training. The dependent variable in this study is \_\_\_.
