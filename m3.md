# M3 Assignment Guide: Thinking Through t-Tests for Comparing Two Means

This guide will help you navigate the M3 assignment, which focuses on choosing and interpreting the correct t-test for comparing two means. The key challenge is learning to distinguish between situations requiring an **independent-samples t-test** (for two different groups) and a **paired-samples t-test** (for one group measured twice).

**Goal:** To master the selection, execution, and interpretation of t-tests in SPSS, with a special focus on understanding the assumptions (like Levene's test) and the logic behind choosing the right analysis.

**General Principles:**

- **The Research Design is Key:** The most important question to ask is: "Are the two sets of scores from the same people or from two different, unrelated groups?" This single question determines which t-test you will use.
- **Assumptions Matter:** Statistical tests have underlying assumptions. For the independent-samples t-test, we must check the assumption of equal variances to know which result to report.
- **Tell the Whole Story:** Don't just state if a result is significant. Report the means for each group/condition to explain the _direction_ of the difference. A full interpretation includes significance, effect size, and the practical meaning of the results.

## Part 1: Data Preparation

**Objective:** Correctly import and configure the M3 dataset in SPSS. Accurate setup is the foundation for valid analysis.

**Process:**

1.  **Import:** Launch SPSS and import the data from the M3 Excel file using `File -> Import Data -> Excel`.
2.  **Configure in "Variable View":**
    - **Measure:** Go to the "Variable View" tab and set the correct "Measure" for each variable. `Think:` Are variables like `Age1`, `Educ`, `Mem1`, and `Mem2` continuous (`Scale`)? What about `Employ` and `Sex` (`Nominal`)?
    - **Values:** For `Nominal` variables like `Employ`, use the "Values" column to assign text labels to the numeric codes (e.g., Value `1` = Label `"Unemployed"`, Value `2` = Label `"Employed"`). This will make your output much easier to read.
3.  **Save:** Save your configured SPSS data file (`.sav`) and your SPSS output file (`.spv`). Remember to submit both.

## Part 2: Q1 - Independent-Samples t-Test (Age by Employment)

**Objective:** To compare the mean age of two independent groups (employed vs. unemployed) and to correctly interpret the assumption test (Levene's test) that accompanies this analysis.

**Concept:** An independent-samples t-test is used when you want to compare the means of a continuous variable between two separate, unrelated groups. Here, your groups are defined by `Employ`, and you are comparing their mean `Age1`.

**How to Run the Test in SPSS:**

- `Hint:` Go to `Analyze -> Compare Means -> Independent-Samples T Test`.
- Move your continuous variable (`Age1`) into the "Test Variable(s)" box.
- Move your categorical grouping variable (`Employ`) into the "Grouping Variable" box.
- Click the **`Define Groups`** button. Enter the numeric codes for your two groups (e.g., `1` for Group 1 and `2` for Group 2). Click `Continue`, then `OK`.

### A. Levene's Test for Equality of Variances

**Concept:** Before you look at the t-test result, you must check its primary assumption: **homogeneity of variances**. This assumption states that the variability (variance) of your outcome variable should be roughly the same in both groups. Levene's test checks this for you.

1.  **Null Hypothesis of Levene's Test:** The null hypothesis for Levene's test is that the variances of the two groups _are equal_ in the population. (σ²_group1 = σ²_group2).
2.  **Is Levene's Test Significant?**
    - In your SPSS output, find the "Independent Samples Test" table. The first two columns are for "Levene's Test for Equality of Variances." Look at the p-value, labeled "Sig."
    - `Think:` A significant result (_p_ ≤ .05) means you _reject_ the null hypothesis of equal variances. A non-significant result (_p_ > .05) means you _fail to reject_ the null, so you can assume the variances are equal.
    - **Action:** Paste the output table and state whether the test is significant by comparing its p-value to α = .05.

3.  **Purpose of Levene's Test:** Its purpose is to determine whether the assumption of equal variances is met. This tells you which row of the t-test output to read.
4.  **Conclusion of Levene's Test:**
    - If Levene's test is **not significant** (_p_ > .05), you conclude that the assumption is met. You will read the **top row** of the t-test results, labeled "Equal variances assumed."
    - If Levene's test is **significant** (_p_ ≤ .05), you conclude that the assumption is violated. You will read the **bottom row** of the results, labeled "Equal variances not assumed."

### B. Interpreting the t-Test

1.  **Null Hypothesis of the t-Test:** The null hypothesis for the main t-test is that the mean `Age1` of the employed group is equal to the mean `Age1` of the unemployed group in the population. (µ_employed = µ_unemployed).
2.  **Effect Size (d):**
    - `Hint:` As of SPSS v.27, you can request effect sizes directly. In the `Independent-Samples T Test` dialog box, check the box for "Estimate effect sizes." SPSS will produce a separate table with Cohen's d.
    - **Action:** Paste this table and report the value for Cohen's d.

3.  **APA Reporting:**
    - From the correct row (determined by Levene's test), find the degrees of freedom (df), the t-statistic (t), and the p-value ("Sig. (2-tailed)").
    - Combine these into a single line using APA format.
    - `Example format:` _t_(df) = [t-value], _p_ = [p-value], _d_ = [Cohen's d value]
4.  **Decision and Rationale:** Compare the p-value from your t-test to α = .05.
    - If _p_ ≤ .05, you **reject the null hypothesis**. Your rationale is that the p-value is less than alpha.
    - If _p_ > .05, you **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. Your rationale is that the p-value is greater than alpha.
5.  **Observation of Means:** Paste the "Group Statistics" table. Compare the mean `Age1` for the employed and unemployed groups. Connect this to your t-test result. For example: "The unemployed group had a slightly higher mean age (M = ...) than the employed group (M = ...), but the t-test showed this difference was not statistically significant."

## Part 3: Q2 - Paired-Samples t-Test (Memory Change)

**Objective:** To determine if there is a significant change in memory scores over time for the same group of participants. This requires selecting and performing a paired-samples t-test.

### A. Selecting the Statistical Test

1.  **What type of t-test?** A **Paired-Samples t-Test** (also known as a dependent-samples or repeated-measures t-test).
2.  **Rationale:** The correct rationale is that you are comparing two scores (`Mem1` and `Mem2`) that come from the **same group of individuals**. The scores are "paired" or "dependent" because they belong to the same person. This is a within-subjects design.

### B. Performing and Interpreting the Test

**How to Run the Test in SPSS:**

- `Hint:` Go to `Analyze -> Compare Means -> Paired-Samples T Test`.
- Click on `Mem1` and then `Mem2`. They will move into the "Paired Variables" box as a pair. Click `OK`.

![Paired Samples T-Test Dialog](/assets/m3-assets/paired-t-test.png)

1.  **Null Hypothesis:** The null hypothesis is that the mean difference between `Mem1` and `Mem2` scores is zero in the population. (µ_difference = 0).
2.  **Effect Size (d):**
    - `Hint:` Just like with the independent test, you can check "Estimate effect sizes" in the `Paired-Samples T Test` dialog box to have SPSS calculate Cohen's d for you.
    - **Action:** Paste the effect size table and report the value.
3.  **APA Reporting:**
    - Find the "Paired Samples Test" table in your output. Locate the values for t, df, and "Sig. (2-tailed)".
    - Report them in a single line in APA format: _t_(df) = [t-value], _p_ = [p-value], _d_ = [Cohen's d value].

![Paired Samples Test Output](/assets/m3-assets/paired-test-output.png)

4.  **Decision and Rationale:** Compare the p-value to α = .05 to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. State your rationale clearly (p vs. alpha).
5.  **Observation of Means:** Paste the "Paired Samples Statistics" table. Compare the mean for `Mem1` and `Mem2`. Did memory scores, on average, increase or decrease from the first to the second session? Connect this observation to your statistical conclusion.

## Part 4: Q3 - Another Independent-Samples t-Test (Education)

**Objective:** To reinforce your ability to select the correct test and interpret the results by comparing education levels between the employed and unemployed groups.

### A. Selecting the Test

1.  **What t-test?** An **Independent-Samples t-Test**.
2.  **Rationale:** The rationale is that you are comparing a continuous variable (`Educ`) between **two different, unrelated groups** of people (defined by `Employ`). This is a between-subjects design.
3.  **Null Hypothesis:** The null hypothesis is that the mean education level of the employed group is equal to the mean education level of the unemployed group in the population. (µ_employed = µ_unemployed).

### B. Performing and Interpreting the Test

- **Process:** Follow the exact same steps as in Q1, but use `Educ` as your "Test Variable." Remember to check Levene's test first!

1.  **Effect Size (d):** Use SPSS to estimate the effect size (Cohen's d).
2.  **APA Reporting:** Report the t-statistic, df, p-value, and effect size in the correct format, making sure to use the values from the row indicated by your Levene's test result.
3.  **Decision and Rationale:** Make your decision about the null hypothesis by comparing p to α.
4.  **Answer the Research Question:** Translate your statistical finding back into a clear answer to the research question. For example: "Yes, the employed and unemployed groups differed significantly in their mean years of education."
5.  **Observation of Means:** Paste the "Group Statistics" table. Which group had a higher mean education level? State the means for both groups and connect this practical observation to your statistical conclusion.

## Tips for Success

1.  **The Golden Rule: One Group or Two?**

    - **Two separate groups** (e.g., employed vs. unemployed, male vs. female, treatment vs. control) = **Independent-Samples t-Test**.
    - **One group measured twice** (e.g., pre-test vs. post-test, time 1 vs. time 2) = **Paired-Samples t-Test**.
    - Mastering this distinction is 90% of the battle for this assignment.

2.  **Levene's Test is Your Guide, Not Your Final Answer.**

    - Levene's test is just a preliminary check. Its only job is to tell you which of the two rows in the `Independent-Samples Test` output to trust. Do not report Levene's p-value as the main result of your study. The main result is the p-value for the t-test itself.

3.  **Context is Everything: Always Look at the Means.**

    - A significant t-test tells you that the means are different, but it doesn't tell you _how_. The `Group Statistics` or `Paired Samples Statistics` table is crucial. Always look at the means to understand and describe the direction and practical meaning of your findings. A good conclusion always mentions the means.

4.  **Automate Effect Size Calculation.**

    - Modern versions of SPSS make it easy to get effect sizes. Get into the habit of checking the "Estimate effect sizes" box every time you run a t-test. This provides a measure of the _magnitude_ or _practical significance_ of your finding, which is just as important as statistical significance.

5.  **Practice APA Precision.**
    - Pay attention to the details: italicize _t_, _p_, and _d_. Include the degrees of freedom in parentheses after _t_. Report the exact p-value unless it is less than .001. Present the statistics in a single, clean line as requested. These details are hallmarks of professional statistical reporting.
