### **Module 5 Statistics Study Guide: Understanding Complex Relationships with Factorial ANOVA**

This module introduces **Factorial ANOVA**, a significant step up from one-way ANOVA. While one-way ANOVA examines the effect of a _single_ Independent Variable (IV), factorial ANOVA allows us to investigate the effects of **two or more IVs simultaneously**, and more importantly, how they **interact** with each other.

#### **Part 1: The "Why" - Beyond Single Factors**

Why not just run multiple one-way ANOVAs for each IV?

1.  **Efficiency:** One factorial ANOVA is more efficient than several separate tests.
2.  **Controlling Error:** Running multiple tests on the same data inflates the risk of a Type I Error (a false positive). Factorial ANOVA keeps this risk under control.
3.  **The Main Reason: Interactions:** The real world is complex. The effect of one factor often depends on the level of another. For example, a new teaching method (Factor A) might work well for advanced students but not for beginners (Factor B). A one-way ANOVA could never uncover this crucial interactive relationship. Factorial ANOVA is specifically designed to test for these **interaction effects**.

#### **Part 2: The Logic of Factorial Design**

A factorial design is described by the number of levels in each IV.

- A study with **two** IVs is a **two-way ANOVA**.
- A study with one IV having 3 levels (e.g., Community Type: City, Suburb, Rural) and a second IV with 2 levels (e.g., Gender: Male, Female) is called a **3x2 factorial design**.
- This design creates 3 x 2 = **6 unique groups** (or "cells") of participants (e.g., urban males, suburban females, etc.).

A two-way ANOVA analyzes the variance in the data to test for three distinct effects:

1.  **Main Effect of Factor A:** Does Factor A have an effect on the DV, _ignoring_ Factor B?
    - _Example:_ Is there a difference in teacher salary across the three community types, averaging across both genders?
2.  **Main Effect of Factor B:** Does Factor B have an effect on the DV, _ignoring_ Factor A?
    - _Example:_ Is there a difference in salary between male and female teachers, averaging across all community types?
3.  **Interaction Effect (A x B):** Does the effect of Factor A _depend on_ the level of Factor B? (Or vice versa).
    - _Example:_ Does the difference in salary between community types _change_ depending on whether you are looking at male or female teachers?

#### **Part 3: The Most Important Concept - The Interaction Effect**

**The interaction is almost always the most important and interesting finding in a factorial ANOVA.**

- **Definition:** An interaction occurs when the effect of one IV is **not the same** at all levels of another IV.
- **The Golden Rule of Interpretation:** **If the interaction effect is statistically significant, you must be very cautious when interpreting the main effects.** A significant main effect can be misleading in the presence of a significant interaction.
  - _Example:_ You might find a significant main effect of "Study Location," suggesting the library is best on average. But a significant interaction might reveal that the library is _only_ best for females, while males do best at home. Reporting only the main effect would be an incomplete and misleading story.

#### **Part 4: The Factorial ANOVA Decision Tree (How to Interpret the Output)**

When you get your SPSS output for a two-way ANOVA, you will see F-tests for Factor A, Factor B, and the Interaction (A x B). Here’s how to proceed:

**Step 1: Look at the Interaction Effect FIRST.**

- **If the Interaction is SIGNIFICANT (p < .05):**

  1.  This is your main story. Report that there is a significant interaction.
  2.  You **must** follow up with "simple effects" tests to understand the nature of the interaction. This involves breaking the study down and running separate one-way ANOVAs or t-tests.
      - _Example:_ Run a one-way ANOVA on "Study Location" for _only the males_, and then another one for _only the females_. This will show you if the location effect is different for the two genders.
  3.  Interpret the main effects with extreme caution or ignore them altogether, as the interaction is the more accurate story.

- **If the Interaction is NOT Significant (p ≥ .05):**
  1.  You can conclude that the effect of Factor A is consistent across all levels of Factor B (and vice versa).
  2.  Now, you can look at the **Main Effects** as separate, independent findings.
  3.  **For each Main Effect that IS significant (p < .05):**
      - If the factor has only 2 levels, you can interpret the difference by looking at the means.
      - If the factor has 3 or more levels, you must run **post-hoc tests** (just like in a one-way ANOVA) to see which specific levels are different from each other.

### **Module 5 Key Takeaways**

- Use **Factorial ANOVA** when you have **two or more IVs** and want to test their individual and combined effects.
- The three key results are the **Main Effect of Factor A**, the **Main Effect of Factor B**, and the **Interaction Effect (A x B)**.
- **Always interpret the INTERACTION effect first.** It is the most critical finding.
- A **significant interaction** means the effect of one IV changes depending on the level of the other IV.
- If the interaction is significant, you must follow up with **simple effects tests** to explore it. Main effects become secondary.
- If the interaction is _not_ significant, you can then interpret any significant **main effects** and use **post-hoc tests** if they have 3+ levels.
