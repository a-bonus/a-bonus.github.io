# M1 Assignment Guide: Foundations of Data Setup and Description

This guide helps you navigate the M1 assignment, focusing on the foundational skills of setting up a dataset in SPSS, generating descriptive statistics, and understanding the core concepts behind them. It encourages you to think critically about the process and what the numbers and graphs represent.

**Goal:** To build your confidence in importing, configuring, and exploring a new dataset using SPSS, and to understand the distinction between sample calculations and population estimates.

**General Principles:**

- **Setup is Everything:** An accurately configured dataset is the foundation of all valid statistical analysis. Time spent here prevents major errors later.
- **Know Your Variables:** Understand the difference between `Nominal' and `Scale' data, as this determines the appropriate summaries and graphs.
- **Labels are Your Friend:** Properly labeling variables and values makes your output clear and easy to interpret.
- **Show Your Work:** For manual calculations, the process is just as important as the final answer.

## Part 1: Q1 - Data Import and Configuration (Extra Credit)

**Objective:** To correctly import data from Excel into SPSS and configure the variables so SPSS understands what each one represents. This is a critical first step for any analysis.

**Process:**

1.  **Import Data:**

    - Open SPSS and import the data from the "Data for M1 Assignment" Excel file.
    - `Hint:` Go to `File -> Import Data -> Excel`. Navigate to your file, select it, and ensure the worksheet is correct. Check that the box "Read variable names from the first row of data" is ticked.

2.  **Configure in "Variable View":**

    - After importing, SPSS will be in "Data View". Click the **"Variable View"** tab at the bottom-left of the screen. This is your control panel for defining variables.

    ![Variable View Tab](/assets/m1-assets/variable-view-tab.png)

    - **A. Set Measure Type:** For each variable, select the correct level of measurement in the "Measure" column.

      - `Think:` What kind of data is this?
        - Is it categorical data that describes groups or categories with no inherent order?
        - Is it continuous numeric data where you can measure intervals and perform mathematical operations?
        - Consider: Employment Status, Computer Type, Age, Hours of Sleep, Cell Phone Mins—which measurement type fits each variable?

      ![SPSS Measure Types](/assets/m1-assets/measures.png)

    - **B. Set Value Labels:** For all `Nominal` variables, you must tell SPSS what the numbers in your data stand for.

      - Click the cell in the "Values" column for a categorical variable (e.g., `Employment Status`). A small button with three dots `...` will appear. Click it.
      - `Hint:` In the dialog box that opens, enter a number in the `Value` box (e.g., `1`) and its corresponding text label in the `Label` box (e.g., `"Employed Full-Time"`). Click `Add`. Repeat for all categories for that variable, then click `OK`. Do this for every nominal/ordinal variable.

      ![SPSS Value Labels](/assets/m1-assets/labels.png)

3.  **Save Your File:**
    - Save your fully configured SPSS data file. The correct extension is `.sav`.
    - **Action:** Name the file as instructed ("Data for M1 assignment – your last name") and remember to submit this file to receive credit.

## Part 2: Q2 - Frequency Tables for Nominal/Ordinal Variables

**Objective:** To summarize categorical data by creating frequency tables, which show the count and percentage of participants in each category.

**Process:**

1.  **Generate Frequencies in SPSS:**

    - `Hint:` Go to `Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Frequencies`.
    - In the dialog box, move the nominal or ordinal variables you want to analyze from the list on the left into the "Variable(s)" box on the right.
    - Click `OK`. SPSS will generate the tables in the Output Viewer window.

    ![Frequencies Dialog](/assets/m1-assets/frequencies-dialog.png)

2.  **Interpret and Paste:**
    - The output table will show each category (based on the Value Labels you set in Part 1), the raw count (`Frequency`), the percentage of the total (`Percent`), and the percentage after excluding missing data (`Valid Percent`).
    - **Action:** For Q2A and Q2B, choose your variables, run the analysis, and copy/paste the resulting frequency tables into your assignment document.

## Part 3: Q3 - Grouped Frequency Tables for Scale Variables

**Objective:** To summarize continuous (scale) data by grouping scores into bins (intervals). This makes it easier to see the shape of the distribution when you have a wide range of values.

**Concept:** Unlike categorical data, each value in a scale variable might be unique. A simple frequency table would be too long. By grouping values (e.g., ages 20-24, 25-29, 30-34), we can create a meaningful summary. SPSS can automate this process.

**Process using Visual Binning:**

1.  **Open Visual Binning:**

    - `Hint:` Go to `Transform -> Visual Binning`.

    ![Visual Binning Menu](/assets/m1-assets/visual-binning-menu.png)

2.  **Select and Configure:**

    - Move the scale variable you want to group (e.g., `Age`) into the "Variables to Bin" box and click `Continue`.
    - In the next window, you will create the bins.
    - Enter a name for your new, binned variable (e.g., `Age_Grouped`).
    - Click the **`Make Cutpoints`** button.
    - Select `Equal Width Intervals`. For the "First Cutpoint Location", enter a value at or just below your data's minimum. For "Number of Cutpoints", enter one less than the number of bins you want (e.g., for 8 bins, enter 7 cutpoints). You can also specify the "Width" of each interval. Click `Apply`.
    - `Think:` The assignment requires at least 8 bins with equal, non-overlapping ranges. The `Make Cutpoints` tool helps you achieve this precisely.
    - Click `OK`. SPSS will create a **new variable** in your dataset with the grouped categories.

3.  **Create the Frequency Table:**
    - Now, run a standard frequency analysis on your **newly created binned variable**.
    - Go to `Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Frequencies`.
    - Select your new variable (e.g., `Age_Grouped`) and run the analysis.
    - **Action:** Paste this final frequency table into your assignment for Q3A and Q3B.

## Part 4: Q4 - Graphing Frequency Distributions

**Objective:** To visually represent data distributions using the correct type of graph for the variable's measurement level.

### A. Bar Graph (for Nominal/Ordinal data)

**Concept:** Bar graphs use separate, distinct bars to represent the frequency of each category. The gaps between bars emphasize that the categories are separate.

**Process:**

1.  **Create the Graph:**

    - `Hint:` The most flexible tool is the Chart Builder. Go to `Graphs -> Chart Builder`.
    - In the "Choose from" list, select `Bar`.
    - Drag the "Simple Bar" icon into the chart preview area.
    - Drag your chosen **nominal or ordinal variable** from the "Variables" list onto the **X-Axis**. The Y-Axis will default to "Count," which is what you want.
    - Click `OK`.

    ![Chart Builder Bar Graph](/assets/m1-assets/chart-builder-bar.png)

2.  **Format and Paste:**
    - The graph will appear in your SPSS Output. Double-click the graph to open the Chart Editor, where you can add a title and edit axis labels to meet the assignment criteria.
    - **Action:** Paste the final, correctly labeled bar graph into your assignment.

### B. Histogram (for Scale data)

**Concept:** Histograms use adjacent bars (no gaps) to show the frequency of scores falling within continuous bins. This illustrates the shape, center, and spread of continuous data.

**Process:**

1.  **Create the Graph:**

    - `Hint:` Go to `Graphs -> Chart Builder`.
    - In the "Choose from" list, select `Histogram`.
    - Drag the "Simple Histogram" icon into the chart preview area.
    - Drag your chosen **scale variable** from the "Variables" list onto the **X-Axis**.
    - Click `OK`.

    ![Chart Builder Histogram](/assets/m1-assets/chart-builder-hist.png)

2.  **Format and Paste:**
    - As with the bar graph, use the Chart Editor to add a title and ensure axis labels are clear.
    - **Action:** Paste the final, correctly labeled histogram into your assignment.

## Part 5: Q5 - Descriptive Statistics: Manual vs. Software

**Objective:** To understand the formulas behind basic descriptive statistics and to see the crucial difference between a _sample's_ standard deviation and the _estimated population_ standard deviation calculated by software.

### A & B. Manual Calculations

- **Concept:** This part is about demonstrating your understanding of the formulas. You must show the steps.
- **Process for the first 10 `AGE` scores:**
  1.  **Mean (M):** Sum all 10 scores and divide by 10 (N). `M = ΣX / N`
  2.  **Median:** List the 10 scores in order from lowest to highest. The median is the average of the two middle scores (the 5th and 6th scores).
  3.  **Range:** Find the highest score and subtract the lowest score. `Range = X_max - X_min`
  4.  **Standard Deviation (SD):** This is a multi-step process.
      - Step 1: Calculate the mean (M) from above.
      - Step 2: For each score (X), calculate its deviation from the mean (X - M).
      - Step 3: Square each of these deviations: (X - M)².
      - Step 4: Sum all the squared deviations. This is the **Sum of Squares (SS)**. `SS = Σ(X - M)²`
      - Step 5: Divide SS by the number of scores (N=10). This is the variance. `Variance = SS / N`
      - Step 6: Take the square root of the variance. This is the **sample standard deviation**. `SD = √ (SS / N)`
- **Action:** Write out these steps with the actual numbers to receive credit.

### C. SPSS/Excel Calculation

- **Process:**
  1.  Create a new, blank SPSS data file. In "Variable View," create one variable named "Age."
  2.  In "Data View," type the first 10 age values into the "Age" column.
  3.  `Hint:` Go to `Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Descriptives`. Move "Age" into the "Variable(s)" box. Click the `Options` button and ensure Mean, Std. deviation, and Range are checked. Click `Continue`, then `OK`. (To get the median, use `Analyze -> Frequencies` and check "Median" in the `Statistics` sub-menu).
- **Action:** Paste the SPSS output table(s) showing the four statistics.

### D. Comparison and Interpretation

- **Concept:** This is the most important part of Q5. You must explain _why_ some numbers match and some don't.

- **1. Mean:**

  - `Think:` Is the formula for a sample mean (`ΣX / N`) different from the formula for an estimated population mean? No. They are calculated identically. Your manually calculated mean should be exactly the same as the SPSS output.

- **2. Standard Deviation:**
  - `Think:` Why is the standard deviation from your manual calculation different from the one in the SPSS output?
  - Consider what formula you used for your manual calculation. What did you divide by?
  - Now consider: What might statistical software be trying to estimate? Is it just describing your sample, or is it trying to make inferences about a larger population?
  - Look at your manual formula and the SPSS result. What might be different in the denominator? Why would software make that choice?
  - Research or reflect on the purpose of dividing by `n-1` versus `N` when calculating standard deviation. What is this adjustment called, and what does it accomplish?
- **Action:** In your answer, explain why the means match but the standard deviations differ. Describe what formula you used manually versus what SPSS calculates by default, and explain the statistical reasoning behind this difference.

## Tips for Success

1.  **Variable View is Your Foundation.**

    - The first thing you should do after importing data is go to Variable View. Setting the correct `Measure` type and defining `Value Labels` for your categorical variables will prevent countless headaches and make your output immediately understandable.

2.  **Match the Method to the Measure.**

    - A core skill is knowing which tool to use for which type of data.
      - **Nominal/Ordinal (Categorical):** Use `Frequencies` for tables and `Bar Charts` for graphs.
      - **Scale (Continuous):** Use `Descriptives` for mean/SD, `Histograms` for graphs, and consider `Visual Binning` to create grouped frequency tables.

3.  **Understand "Sample" vs. "Population Estimate".**

    - Question 5 is designed to teach you a critical statistical concept. When you describe _only the data you have_, you divide by N. When you use your data to _estimate for a larger group_, you divide by n-1. Statistical software defaults to the latter because we are almost always doing inferential statistics.

4.  **Label Everything Clearly.**

    - Your graphs and tables should be able to stand on their own. Always ensure your charts have a descriptive title and clearly labeled X and Y axes. This is a crucial part of communicating your findings professionally.

5.  **Save Your Files Correctly.**
    - Remember the assignment requires you to submit both the SPSS data file (`.sav`) and the output file (`.spv`). Get into the habit of saving both as you work. The output file serves as a record of every analysis you've run.
