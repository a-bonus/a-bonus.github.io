# M5 Assignment Guide: Independent-Samples t-Tests

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M5 assignment, focusing on independent-samples t-tests for comparing two separate groups.

**Goal:** To master the independent-samples t-test and understand how to compare and contrast all three types of t-tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Determine when an independent-samples t test is appropriate for a given research scenario
- Define pooled variance and discuss why it is necessary for conducting an independent means t test
- Perform and interpret an independent-samples t test
- Compare and contrast the three types of t tests (modules 4 & 5) and identify the appropriate t test for a given research scenario
- Identify the assumptions that need to be met for any t test
- Compare and contrast the different t tests in terms of degree of freedom and effect size calculations

## Module Overview

Comparing two separate groups is a very common approach in research and in the real world. Even though we seem to be comparing two means of the groups, we do need to figure out all the ways that the two groups differ. For example, the average (mean) of {1, 3, 5, 7} is 4 but so is the average (mean) of {4, 4, 4}. The two groups of numbers differ both in group size and in the variance within each group, so the statistical test for comparing two different groups takes all those factors into consideration before producing a result.

After learning the independent-means (or independent-samples) t-test, we will review and compare the three different t-tests we've learn in this course. Believe it or not, we have now completed the training of a huge portion of critical statistical concepts. These concepts will enable you to master any advanced statistics with relative ease!
