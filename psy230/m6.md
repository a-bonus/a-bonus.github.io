# M6 Assignment Guide: Correlation Analysis

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M6 assignment, focusing on bivariate correlation, scatterplots, and correlational analysis.

**Goal:** To understand correlational analysis, learn to create and interpret scatterplots, calculate and interpret Pearson's correlation, and understand common errors in interpreting correlations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Graph relationships between variables using scatterplots and describe the relationship between two variables using scatterplots
- Calculate and interpret the direction and magnitude of a Pearson's correlation
- Define r² and how it differs from the correlation coefficient
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for correlational analysis
- Interpret the results from a hypothesis test using bivariate correlation, including significance and effect size
- Compare and contrast group comparison and correlational analysis
- Identify the independent and dependent variables in a research question

## Module Overview

In inferential statistics, there are two general types of data analysis: One is group comparison, and the other is correlational analysis. So far we have been learning to compare groups in the past few modules so now we will switch over to learning about correlational analysis. As we will see, correlations are everywhere and they make intuitive sense in real-world scenarios. But they are also easily misinterpreted so we will learn all about those common errors people make.
