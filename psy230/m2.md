# M2 Assignment Guide: Foundations of Inferential Statistics

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M2 assignment, focusing on the foundations of inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and probability.

**Goal:** To understand the relationship between samples and populations, learn about hypothesis testing, and explore probability principles in statistics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Discuss inferential statistics in terms of the relationship between a sample and a population
- Discuss the sampling process with probability principles
- Explain the concept of hypothesis testing
- Compare Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing
- Define and calculate Z scores for a normal distribution
- Use the Z table to convert between Z scores and proportions in a normal distribution
- Discuss the concept of sampling distribution (the distribution of sample means)

## Module Overview

In the last module, we learned to organize and display a set of numbers and to calculate descriptive statistics for summarizing the group of numbers. Now we are ready to consider statistics beyond describing the numbers we have in our hands. In both popular media and scholarly research, people like to tell stories that are not confined to the data they actually collected. For example, the polling agency asked the opinions of several hundred people on presidential candidate X and then infer that the whole country thinks this way about X. For social scientists, such a process of making inferences needs to be more stringent, which is why we have statistics to help us tell our stories from a bunch of numbers. In this module, we lay down the foundation for inferential statistics.
