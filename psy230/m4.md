# M4 Assignment Guide: t-Tests for Single Groups

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M4 assignment, focusing on one-sample and paired-samples t-tests.

**Goal:** To understand when to use t-tests instead of z-tests, and to master both one-sample and paired-samples t-tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Determine when it is appropriate to conduct a t test rather than a z test in a given scenario
- Identify the differences between a t-distribution and a z-distribution (normal distribution)
- Estimate the standard error (standard deviation of a sampling distribution) using sample statistics in the context of single-sample or paired-samples t-tests
- Define and calculate degrees of freedom and discuss how they influence the shape of a t-distribution
- Identify one-sample t test or paired-samples t test as appropriate for a given research scenario
- Perform and interpret one-sample and paired-samples t tests

## Module Overview

Now that we know the basic process of hypothesis testing, we will start to look at how researchers actually do it. Why do you need to know how researchers do it if you are not going to be doing research yourself? Well, this knowledge will change how you interpret any report that involves statistical analysis, which is everywhere in our lives. For example, you look at a clinical study on the medicine prescribed by your doctor and you may find that the comparison between people taking the medicine and those taking a sugar pill (placebo) don't really look all that different in the outcome measure and you wonder why the drug is even on the market. After this module, you will have new insights into the claims made by drug commercials!

In this module, we focus on looking at one group (of people or any sort of entity). There are two questions we could ask, each can be answered with a unique statistical test:

1. How is this group compared to a given standard?
2. How is this group doing at different time points (or places, or aspects... etc.)?
