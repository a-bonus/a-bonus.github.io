# M7 Assignment Guide: Non-Parametric Tests and Chi-Square

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M7 assignment, focusing on alternatives to parametric tests, including chi-square tests and non-parametric approaches.

**Goal:** To understand when parametric tests are not appropriate and learn alternative approaches including chi-square tests and data transformation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Review each of the tests covered in this course and identify research scenarios associated with each test
- Discuss strategies of analyzing data when the dependent variable is not normally distributed, such as data transformation and rank-order tests
- Discuss the logic behind chi-square test for goodness of fit and chi-square test for independence
- Perform and interpret hypothesis testing result from a chi-square test for independence or a chi-square test for goodness of fit

## Module Overview

The truth is, the most commonly used statistical analyses, including all the ones we have learned so far (correlation, t-tests, ANOVA), are only applicable when the population distribution is at least roughly consistent with a bell curve (i.e. a normal distribution). The mathematics behind those analyses are based on the assumption that we have a normal distribution. So what do we do when the population distribution for the dependent variable doesn't look anything like a bell even remotely? We will talk about two such scenarios and what we can do in those cases.
