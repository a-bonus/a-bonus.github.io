[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to give you a list of key concepts and skills that you could expect to see on the final exam. However, the best strategy is to create your own study guide based on the topics we emphasized during the course. Then, after you've done that, come back here and see if you missed anything.

## Key Terms

- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (range, standard deviation, variance)
- Graphs (frequency distribution, histogram, line graph, bar graph, pie chart)
- Correlation coefficient
- Different types of reliability
- Different types of validity
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Type I and Type II error
- Alpha (as it relates to hypothesis testing)

## Key Skills

- Selecting appropriate measures of central tendency
- Distinguishing between correlational and causal claims
- Develop null and alternative hypotheses
- Calculate and interpret standard scores
- Selecting analyses using the test decision tree
- Identifying levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
- Creating graphs
- Calculating area under the curve using the standard normal distribution
- Conducting and interpreting:
  - one-sample z-tests
  - one-sample t-tests
  - paired-samples t-tests
  - independent-samples t-tests
  - ANOVA
  - correlations
  - Chi square
