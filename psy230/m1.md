# M1 Assignment Guide: Descriptive Statistics and Data Organization

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M1 assignment, focusing on organizing, displaying, and summarizing data using descriptive statistics.

**Goal:** To build your understanding of descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, measures of central tendency and variability, and proper data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Compare and contrast descriptive and inferential statistics
- Examine frequency distributions of a data set
- Describe the characteristics of a data set that is normally distributed, including skewness and kurtosis
- Identify and create graphs (histogram, bar graph, pie chart) that can best represent the given data
- Calculate:
  - Central tendency: mean, median, mode
  - Spread of distribution: range, standard deviation, variance
- Define the different kinds of variables and their measurement and identify the variable type(s) for a given data set
- Format tables and graphs in APA style

## Module Overview

Statistics is just a term for describing the set of concepts and techniques that we use to make sense of large groups of numbers. Because our brain has a limited capacity to hold many things in focus at once, we simply can't directly process a large group of numbers in a meaningful way. In this module, we learn some ways to help our brain see patterns (or stories) out of a large set of seemingly random numbers.

There are a lot of learning objectives to achieve this week, but a lot of them must be familiar to you already so this module is more like a refresher.
