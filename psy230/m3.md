# M3 Assignment Guide: Z-Tests and Hypothesis Testing

[← Back to PSY 230 Course Index](/psy230)

This guide helps you navigate the M3 assignment, focusing on Z-tests, statistical significance, effect size, and statistical power.

**Goal:** To master hypothesis testing using z-tests, understand what statistical significance means, and learn about effect size and power.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Discuss a sampling distribution (distribution of sample means) in relation to the Z table
- Define and calculate the standard error (of the means)
- Discuss the assumptions of hypothesis testing
- Conduct all the necessary steps to perform and interpret a Z test on a hypothesis
- Define statistical significance and determine if a given statistical result is significant or not
- Explain the concept of confidence interval with examples
- Explain what effect size means, the factors behind effect size, and its relationship to statistical significance
- Discuss the factors that influence the power of a statistical test and how power is related to statistical significance

## Module Overview

In this module, we take the idea of hypothesis testing into a somewhat more realistic research situations where we use a group of numbers (instead of one data point) to test a hypothesis. Along the way, we will learn the answers to the following questions: What does it mean when the hypothesis test is "significant"? What's the effect of having a large or small sample? What is the "effect" in the calculation of effect size?
