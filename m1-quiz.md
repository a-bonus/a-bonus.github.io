Quiz Instructions
Instruction:

Students are allowed two attempts on the quiz by the due date. The higher score will be used toward the calculation of the final grade.
The questions are randomly drawn from a question bank for each attempt, so the two attempts may not have identical questions.
The quiz is open-book/open-note, to be completed in 90 minutes. Once you start this quiz, you must finish it in one sitting because the timer does not stop if you leave the quiz.
The quiz covers the concepts from the readings and video lectures in this module, but may touch on concepts from previous modules.
Note: this is a timed quiz. You may check the remaining time you have at any point while taking the quiz by pressing the keyboard combination SHIFT, ALT, and T... Again: SHIFT, ALT, and T...

Flag question: Question 6
Question 61 pts
A researcher is interested in the eventual divorce rates of people who live together before they get married compared to those who do not cohabitate before marriage. Any difference found between these groups would be of interest to the researcher, as well as to the popular media. Which statement is an appropriate null hypothesis for this research?

There is a difference in divorce rates between those who cohabitate before marriage and those who do not.

People who do not cohabitate before marriage have a divorce rate twice as high as those who cohabitate before marriage.

There is no difference in divorce rates between those who cohabitate before marriage and those who do not.

People who cohabitate before marriage have a divorce rate twice as high as those who do not.
